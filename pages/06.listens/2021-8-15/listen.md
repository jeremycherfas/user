Episode summary: “Country roads, take me home To the place I belong” Written by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert with and for their friend John Denver, the song went on to be covered by Ray Charles, Toots and the Maytals, Olivia Newton John and many more. A song about the longing for home and the desire to be back with the people you love, ‘Country Roads’ has become one of the official state songs of West Virginia but it also speaks to people from around the world and across political divides. It’s a song about togetherness, belonging, homesickness, the immigrant experience and the hold that the landscape of your ‘home place’ can have on you. Featuring contributions from Bill Danoff, Sarah Morris, Jason Jeong, Ngozi Fulani, Lloyd Bradley and Alison Wells. And from Molly Sarlé, Alexandra Sauser-Monnig and Amelia Meath of the band Mountain Man. Produced by Mair Bosworth for BBC Audio in Bristol
