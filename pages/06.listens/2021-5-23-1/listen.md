Episode summary: A hush descends as Josie Long presents short documentaries and audio adventures about silence. From an artwork that pulls sounds outside of the range of human hearing within it - vibrations in the soil, the sound of bats in Senegal caught on a supersonic microphone - to a story about the silence which lies between generations in a family.
