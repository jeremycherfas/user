Episode summary: Britain prides itself on being impregnable; a country which hasn&rsquo;t been invaded for 1000 years and can&rsquo;t be bought. The Lebedevs give the lie to all that. They spent a lot, but not a fortune, buying their way into British public life. And they did it in a way which perhaps nobody had tried before: they amused the people who mattered.To access the first 3 episodes now subscribe to Tortoise+ on Apple Podcasts or join Tortoise as a member.
