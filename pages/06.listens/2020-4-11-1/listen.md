Episode summary: In April of 1995, wildlife biologists flew small airplanes over Yellowstone National Park, looking for two missing wolves. “They’re just gone. And that’s implausible because wolves don’t just disappear.” We’re trying something new. Two stories about the same family of wolves in Yellowstone. One is a crime story, and one is a love story. For the love story, check out Episode 19 of This is Love. It’s called The Wolves. https://apple.co/2wSJs7B Thomas McNamee’s book is The Killing of Wolf Number Ten.
