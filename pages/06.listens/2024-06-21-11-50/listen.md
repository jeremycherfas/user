Episode summary: Welcome to Season 7: Capitalism. The world&rsquo;s dominant economic system is on trial as it hasn&rsquo;t been for at least half a century. This season tells the story of capitalism &mdash; how people with power built and shaped it over time. We&rsquo;ll also explore what to do now that many people see capitalism as the problem, not the solution. Produced by host/producer John Biewen with co-host Ellen McGirt and story editor Loretta Williams. From the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University, in partnership with Imperative 21.
