Episode summary: The quality of hospital food around the country remains a very mixed picture, despite various initiatives over the last decades. But now there is real optimism around a major Independent Review of NHS Hospital Food in England, published in 2020. Sheila Dillon looks at the barriers that have been holding back progress, and talks to Prue Leith, an Independent Advisor for the review, about the latest on progress with carrying through its recommendations. Sheila meets catering teams at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, and the Royal Blackburn Teaching hospital, both part of a group of pioneering &lsquo;exemplar&rsquo; NHS Trusts that are doing things differently with hospital meals, to find out how they&rsquo;re building a model that others can follow. Presented by Sheila Dillon and produced by Sophie Anton for BBC Audio in Bristol.
