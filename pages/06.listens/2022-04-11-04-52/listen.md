Episode summary: this week to share an episode from our friends&rsquo; podcast. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an excellent show hosted by Cindy Cohn and Danny O&rsquo;Brien called How to Fix the Internet. Our show has a lot in common with theirs &ndash; in fact it has so much in common that they had Ethan on their show back in January. We&rsquo;re that interview today, and if you enjoy it, be sure to subscribe to How to Fix the Internet for more.
