Episode summary: In 1934, a man collecting driftwood along the Lake Erie shore found a human torso on the beach. No one could figure out what had happened. Over the next several years, more bodies were discovered. Eventually, a coroner assembled something he called the &ldquo;Torso Clinic&rdquo; to work on the case. It was made up of about 30 people &ndash; doctors, professors, police officers, and a young Prohibition agent named Eliot Ness.
