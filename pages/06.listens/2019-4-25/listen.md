Episode summary: This week, my talk with Karima Moyer, author of The Eternal Table, a culinary history of Rome from its founding to the present. We talk about how she ended up moving to Italy 30 years ago, how she ended up writing books about Italian culinary history after studying theatrical design and dramaturgy, and what it’s like to still be treated like an immigrant after such a long time living there. If you’re interested in Italian food beyond just recipes, pick up her books. They will not disappoint.
