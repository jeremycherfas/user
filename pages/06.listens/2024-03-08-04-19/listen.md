Episode summary: For the second episode in our new series on the Ideas Behind American Elections, David and Gary discuss 1828: the first great populist election, which saw the arrival of Andrew Jackson and a new style of politics in the White House. What made Jackson different from his predecessors? How did this election reinvent the American party system? And why were Jackson&rsquo;s arguments with Vice-President John Calhoun about economic tariffs so toxic that they brought the country close to civil war?To sign up for our free fortnightly newsletter to accompany this and future series, just click on the top link in our Link Tree: https://linktr.ee/ppfideasComing up next: the Election of 1860 and Abraham Lincoln Hosted on Acast.
