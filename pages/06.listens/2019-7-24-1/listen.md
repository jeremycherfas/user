Episode summary: If you disagree with someone — if you find what they think appalling — is there any value in talking to them? In the early 1970s, the talk show host Dick Cavett, the governor of Georgia Lester Maddox, and the singer Randy Newman tried to answer this question.

I'm not sure that Maddox was trying to answer that same question, but no matter; I found this one of the most interesting episodes so far (along with the Larry Adler's memories pair). And of course Newman is not the only songwriter whose work has been completely misunderstood. Springsteen's *Born in the USA* leaps to mind, and I'm sure there are others.
