Episode summary: Rioters carried many familiar flags during the January 6th insurrection at the United States Capitol &mdash; Confederate, MAGA, as well as some custom-made ones like a flag of Trump looking like Rambo. Except for onlookers who were already familiar with the design, it would have been easy to overlook one particular bright yellow flag with three red horizontal stripes across the center. This was the flag of South Vietnam.
