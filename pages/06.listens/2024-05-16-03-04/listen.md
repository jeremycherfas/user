Episode summary: 5x15 brings together five outstanding individuals to tell of their lives, passions and inspirations. There are only two rules - no scripts and only 15 minutes each. Andrew O&rsquo;Hagan is one of the most exciting and serious chroniclers of our times. Born in Glasgow, he has been nominated for the Booker Prize three times, was voted one of Granta&rsquo;s Best of Young British Novelists in 2003 and won the E. M. Forster Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is Editor-at-Large of the London Review of Books and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His previous novel, Mayflies, won huge acclaim, was a Waterstones Scottish Book of the Month and was adapted for television in an award-winning two-part BBC drama starring Martin Compston and Tony Curran. His highly anticipated new book Caledonian Road is, in the words of Joshua Cohen, &lsquo;a brilliant state-of-the-nation novel that pulls down the facades of high society and knocks over the &ldquo;good liberal&rdquo; house of cards&rsquo;.
