Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. Music We start off with Chez Thomas, by Charles Delarue Go to The Graceful Ghost, one of William Bolcom’s 3 Ghost Rags. Then Krzysztof Komeda’s Ballet Edude II A touch of Ellington playing A Single Petal on a Rose. Then Concerto no. 5 en la minuer: Allegro ma non molto, as performed by Wilhelm Friedeman Bach and Brigitte Haudbebourg frames… Philharmonics - Piano Sessions found on the Deluxe Edition of Agnes Obel’s Philharmonics album. Then we go to Nathaniel Johnson’s gorgeous, Penelope’s Theme from the score to the delightful film, The Brothers Bloom. Sneeuwland by Oskar Schuster. Judith by Jacob David. Notes I read a bunch of articles on Jackie, but if you’re looking for one-stop-shopping that can send you off in other research avenues, I’d probably suggest this article by Zack Harold in Lapham’s Quarterly.
