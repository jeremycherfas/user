Episode summary: Raymond Blanc has spent decades growing an orchard at Le Manoir. An orchard Raymond has planted with 2500 rare trees from in the hope of saving lost and endangered varieties. He explains to Dan Saladino why the orchard might end up being his greatest legacy, a story he has captured in his book, The Lost Orchard. He also selects five different apples that help tell his life story. Dr Joan Morgan, the world’s leading pomologist, described as the ‘Queen of Apples’ helps to tell the stories of the varieties Raymond has chosen. Produced and presented by Dan Saladino.
