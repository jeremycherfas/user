Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Anyway… Music We start with 666 from the score to The Omen. Transition to Fremd by Lambert. Go to Monster Mash by Bobby “Boris” Pickett. Hear some of Leonard Berstein’s score to Rebel Without a Cause. Hit Denmark by the Portland Cello Project And hear some of Musette’s On the Green Tape. Notes Bobby’s story is covered in a lot of histories of one hit wonders and novelty tunes. But, if you want to really dig in, you should read, Monster Mash: Half Dead in Hollywood, his autobiography.
