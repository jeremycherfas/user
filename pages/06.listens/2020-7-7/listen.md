Episode summary: Wendy Zukerman is the host and executive producer of Science Vs. “There is an expectation that if you have a platform you have an agenda. And whereas — for better or worse — me, personally, I don’t have particularly strong opinions about things that I don’t know about. It’s what makes the show possible. I’m terrible at other things in life, but when it comes to issues, I’m pretty good at knowing, oh, I actually don’t know anything about that. I shouldn’t be having an opinion. And I just want to know the facts.”
