Episode summary: In the fight against global warming we&rsquo;re constantly told to do our bit to reduce green house gas emissions. However, a claim circulating that just &lsquo;100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions&rsquo; can make any individual effort seem futile. But does this claim mean what you think it means? We look into this and the claim that the pandemic pushed South African stress levels up by 56%. With guests Abbas Panjwani from Fullfact and Kirsten Cosser from Africa Check. (Image: Power plant emitting smoke at sunset. Credit: Enviromantic/Getty)
