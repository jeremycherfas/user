Episode summary: From The History Podcast, this is Invisible Hands. This is the story of a hidden force that changed Britain forever &mdash; free market capitalism &mdash; and the invisible hands that shaped it.David Dimbleby traces the history of an idea that charts his lifespan. It started in a fighter plane in the Battle of Britain, gained traction in shadowy post-war London backrooms and rose to heights of excess in the new champagne bars of the City. Now it&rsquo;s 2025 and it has come to define every aspect of life in Britain. An idea that transformed the economy, politics and, ultimately, society itself.But how did it happen? Who are the little known people behind it? What did they want?And - as Donald Trump threatens to overturn the global economic system - is the free market here to stay? Or are we entering a new era?
