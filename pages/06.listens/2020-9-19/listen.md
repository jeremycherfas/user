Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independent podcasts from PRX. A note on notes: We’d much rather you just went into each episode of The Memory Palace cold. And just let the story take you where it well. So, we don’t suggest looking into the show notes first. Music Them by Nils Frahm Feathers by Poppy Ackroyd Notes You can read Myles Horton’s book. I found The Birth of Citizen Schools: Entwining the Struggles for Literacy and Freedom by David P. Levine particularly useful. And especially Clare Russell’s “A Beautician Without Teacher Training: Bernice Robinson, Citizen Schools and women in the Civil Rights Movement.”
