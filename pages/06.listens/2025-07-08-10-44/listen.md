Episode summary: Feeding kids a healthy lunch every school day is a feat of science and logistics. Molded into shape by nutrition scientists who wanted to optimize children&rsquo;s health, the school lunch has endured war, economic depression, and even a global pandemic&hellip;.

Interesting listen full, as the host acknowledged, of unintended consequences.The fully intenetional consequence that I cannot wrap my head around is why any half-arsed nation state would not view feeding its children as an investment rather than an expense. The episode made the point that money could be found for infrastructure like kitchens, but not for the food to cook nor the cooks. Are children not the infrastucture of the community?
