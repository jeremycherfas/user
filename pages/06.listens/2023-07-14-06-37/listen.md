Episode summary: In an old country town high school library there is a glass case that displays something highly unusual and, for some, confronting. Inside that glass case is a mummified head and according to its plaque, it was donated to Grafton High School in 1915. Now, over 100 years later, questions are being raised about where it really came from and whether it really belongs there. This podcast is a co-production of ABC Australia and CBC Podcasts.
