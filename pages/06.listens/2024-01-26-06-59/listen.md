Episode summary: In the 1950s the CIA weaponized culture to capture hearts and minds in Europe and Africa. We meet three writers (Richard Wright, Kenneth Tynan, and Dwight Macdonald) who got caught up in this battle both as collaborators and targets between the years of 1956 - 1960. We also meet a propagandist responsible for the CIA&rsquo;s cinematic version of 1984 (Operation Big Brother) and &ldquo;books that don&rsquo;t smack of propaganda&rdquo; aimed at European Intellectuals - including James Baldwin&rsquo;s Notes of a Native Son. Shownotes: Fran&ccedil;oise Verg&egrave;s is the author of A decolonial Feminism, James Campbell is the author of Paris Interzone and Talking at the Gates, Jelena Ä†ulibrk writes on IRD and Newsreels, Tony Shaw writes on British Cinema and the Cold War, Support ToE and get access to the incredible exclusive bonus companion series to Not All Propaganda is Art by subscribing at https://theoryofeverything.supercast.com/, or subscribe directly in Apple Podcasts by hitting &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo; right on the show page.
