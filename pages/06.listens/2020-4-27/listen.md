Episode summary: Journalist and bestselling author Michael Lewis (Liar’s Poker, Moneyball) takes a searing look at what’s happened to fairness. It feels like there’s less of it every day—whether it comes to lending practices, college admissions, professional sports, or psychological well-being. Who are the people trying to level the playing field, and are they making an impact? In the second season, Lewis looks at the rise in coaching in American life, bringing his trademark insight and wry humor to their stories of (in)equality today. Learn more about your ad choices.
