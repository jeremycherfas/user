Episode summary: Are.na might be the most exciting social network for designers, artists, and curious, interdisciplinary self-educators, kind of like Pinterest or Tumblr but offering the functionality to spin a vast web of images and knowledge. The platform is currently celebrating its 10th anniversary, so we invited two of Are.na&rsquo;s co-founders to talk to us about the close-knit (and often paying) community that makes the site vibrant and how the platform&rsquo;s systems of Blocks and Channels makes it an ideal tool for connecting ideas and creating trains of thought.
