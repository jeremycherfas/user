Episode summary: Errol Morris’s documentaries are visually unmistakable, whether they’re about pet cemeteries or the morally bankrupt “great men” of American history. Thanks to his optical invention, the “Interrotron,” Morris’s subjects’ are looking straight at those of us in the movie theater and, sometimes, lying. He’s one of cinema’s most distinctive storytellers. In conversation with Alec, Morris recounts his meandering path to the top, involving deep debt, a master’s degree in Philosophy, and a stint as a private investigator. “Film-making saved me,” he says. Morris also responds to the heated controversy surrounding his new documentary, American Dharma, about Trump strategist Stephen Bannon, rejecting the argument that it was wrong to provide Bannon a platform for his ideas.
