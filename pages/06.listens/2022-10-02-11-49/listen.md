Episode summary: In their new book Hollywood and Israel, film scholars Tony Shaw and Giora Goodman take us behind and beyond the screen to show how the world&rsquo;s entertainment capital is an important player in international affairs and how profit always trumps propaganda.

Interesting episode, although I wish it could have been more up-to date and considred some of the more recent made for television dramas coming out of Israel.
