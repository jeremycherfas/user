Episode summary: Michael Lewis did not rest long on his laurels after publishing Liar&rsquo;s Poker. In the 1990s, he hit the presidential campaign trail, writing a series of magazine pieces. Some of his dispatches got adapted for audio by a then-new public radio show called &ldquo;This American Life.&rdquo; Michael speaks with the show&rsquo;s creator, Ira Glass, about how they both found their voices as storytellers. Trigger warning: this episode contains vintage NPR sounds. You can order the new Liar&rsquo;s Poker audiobook at Pushkin.fm/LiarsPoker.
