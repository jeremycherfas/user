Episode summary: At the end of 2020, George proposed to his girlfriend, Sandra, after one year of dating. Well, technically it was after years of friendship then one year of dating. When the two met as teenagers at a Ugandan event, they were both finding their place in the world. For George, Uganda provided answers that Britain couldn’t. Like many in their generation, he and Sandra developed a pattern of holidaying in the Motherland before returning to their lives in the UK. However, as the harsh realities of African politics became clear to George, he began to rethink his relationship with UG.
