Episode summary: Here are More or Less we&rsquo;ll all about the facts. Every day we use a toolkit of known proofs to try and answer our listeners&rsquo; questions. But who do we have to thank for this toolkit and how did they set about proving the unknown? Luckily for us mathematician Adam Kucharski has just written a book about this very topic called &lsquo;Proof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty&rsquo;. Join us to hear more about some of the proof pioneers included in his book, from estimating the number of German tanks during WW2 to an unsung heroine of statistics. Presenter: Tim Harford Producer: Lizzy McNeill Series Producer: Tom Colls Editor: Richard Vadon Production Co-ordinator: Brenda Brown Sound Mix: Annie Gardiner
