Episode summary: Jason Cotter grows heritage wheat and mills it into flour at Tuerong Farm on the Mornington Peninsula. The Peninsula, an hour from Melbourne, is better known as a wine region but Jason&rsquo;s interest in local grain economies and his fascination with the fundamental place of wheat in the human story has taken him down a different path. https://www.tuerongfarm.com.au Follow The Producers on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/producerspodcast/ Host Anthony Huckstep https://www.instagram.com/huckstergram/ Host Dani Valent https://www.instagram.com/danivalent Executive Producer Rob Locke https://www.instagram.com/foodwinedine/ LISTEN TO OUR OTHER FOOD PODCASTS https://linktr.ee/DeepintheWeedsNetwork
