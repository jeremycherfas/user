Episode summary: Tourism & travel: Laurie Taylor explores their past, present and future. He’s joined by the Italian social theorist, Marco D’ Eramo, whose latest book unpacks a global cultural phenomenon at the point at which some of us are considering the possibilities of foreign travel, once again. How did travelling, as an elite pastime, evolve into mass tourism? Why do tourists often despise other tourists? How ‘authentic’ is the average heritage site? What impact does tourism have on our cities and the environment? Might we find more ‘otherness’ by staying at home? They’re joined by Emily Thomas, Associate Professor of Philosophy at Durham University, whose research has found that philosophers have theorised extensively about the meaning and purpose of travel in a quest to understand the complexity of the world and of ourselves. Thinking Allowed is produced in partnership with the Open University. Producer: Jayne Egerton
