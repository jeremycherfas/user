Episode summary: In the winter of 1803, residents outside of London reported strange encounters with a ghost. Some said it looked like Napoleon Bonaparte, or a horse without a head. Others said the ghost breathed fire and smoke. By Christmas, there was a &ldquo;full-scale phantom panic.&rdquo; Shortly after the New Year, one man decided he&rsquo;d stop the ghost once and for all. Say hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
