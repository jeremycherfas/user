Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia. Music Blink from Hiroshi Yoshimura Which comes in and out of Bjolukor Tonlisterakoli Reykjanesbaejar’s version of Sigur Ros’ Hoppipolla. Love Token by Elena Kats-Chernin, performed by Tamara Anna Cislowska And Joanna Brouk playing Maggi’s Flute - Lifting Off Notes There’s a ton out there about the sixty starlings, the most comprehensive comes from Stephen Marche’s book, How Shakespeare Changed Everything. I also found Kim Todd’s [Tinkering with Eden,](https://www.amazon.com/Tinkering-Eden-Natural-History-Exotics/dp/0393048608) particularly useful.
