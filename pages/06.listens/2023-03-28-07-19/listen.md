Episode summary: A remixed complete version of our two part Watergate series from last year: Journalists may write the first draft of history but Hollywood prints the legends and the myths. The 1976 film All the President&rsquo;s Men remains our most authoritative account of Watergate. The film is also responsible for the myth of Deep Throat. Your host follows the myth&hellip; from 1976 to the present. Plus a reporter from the Washington Post newsroom who never made it into All the President&rsquo;s Men yet did more to safeguard the free press and American democracy than Woodstein ever did.
