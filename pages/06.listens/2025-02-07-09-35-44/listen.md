Episode summary: Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss slime mould, a basic organism that grows on logs, cowpats and compost heaps. Scientists have found difficult to categorise slime mould: in 1868, the biologist Thomas Huxley asked: &lsquo;Is this a plant, or is it an animal? Is it both or is it neither?&rsquo; and there is a great deal scientists still don&rsquo;t know about it. But despite not having a brain, slime mould can solve complex problems: it can find the most efficient way round a maze and has been used to map Tokyo&rsquo;s rail network. Researchers are using it to help find treatments for cancer, Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and computer scientists have designed an algorithm based on slime mould behaviour to learn about dark matter. It&rsquo;s even been sent to the international space station to help study the effects of weightlessness.
