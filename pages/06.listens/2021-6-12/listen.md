Episode summary: On November 12th, 2012, the Accomack County volunteer fire departments got a call. An abandoned house had suddenly gone up in flames. And then, just hours later, a second fire was reported. Then a third. Over the next few months, there would be a lot more fires—nearly 90 in all. It was all anyone could talk about in Accomack. Someone was burning down the entire county. Monica Hesse’s book is American Fire: Love, Arson, and Life in a Vanishing Land. It’s the Radiotopia Spring Fundraiser!
