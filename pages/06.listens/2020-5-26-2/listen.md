Episode summary: A listener asks if there can really only be 60 harvests left in Earthâ€™s soil. Are we heading for an agricultural Armageddon? Plus we meet the parrots who are the first animals, outside humans and great apes, to be shown to understand probability. (image: Kea parrots in New Zealand)
