Episode summary: In the later part of the 20th century, a pioneering group of economists started shaking up their academic field.These &ldquo;behavioural economists&rdquo; used findings from experimental psychology and everyday life to challenge the prevailing view that human beings were rational decision makers &ndash; acting in predictable ways to maximize their wealth.One of those pioneers was Richard Thaler, who noted down some of these &ldquo;anomalies&rdquo; in a column in the 1980s, which was turned into a book - The Winner&rsquo;s Curse - first published in 1992. His work also won him the Nobel memorial prize in economics in 2017.More than 30 years on, he has returned to that book, publishing a new, updated version with co-author Alex Imas, which looks at whether those anomalies in rational thinking have stood the test of time. Tim asks him to set out two of his most famous ideas &ndash; the winner&rsquo;s curse itself, and the idea of &ldquo;mental accounting&rdquo;.Presenter: Tim Harford Series producer: Tom Colls Sound mix: Donald MacDonald Editor: Richard Vadon
