Episode summary: 

Having listened to this first episode via Huffduffer, I decided to subscribe to the podcast only to discover (I fear) that my robot doesn’t seem to pick up the details from Overcast. If it had, I would have noted that this is possibly a podcast where good content will outweigh bad audio. But seriously, even the host’s audio was terrible. How can anyone allow that to happen when it is so easy to avoid?
