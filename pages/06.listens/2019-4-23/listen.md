Episode summary: World-renowned fermentation revivalist Sandor Ellix Katz embarks upon a philosophical and biological journey into the origins of multicellular life, and how the multi-species activity of fermenting foods has played a central role in the evolution of microbes, our bodies— and even our culture. “To embrace bacteria particularly as part of our food is a great way to make sure we are increasing biodiversity in our own bodies and maximizing our adaptive potential by embracing the presence of bacteria within us.” — Ox Tales is produced by Anna Sigrithur, edited by Naomi Duguid and Fiona Sinclair and mixed by Thomas Krause. Music in this episode was by Thomas Krause, Ava Glendinning, Sara Afonso, The Jungle, the Cavern, and Sam Bikov.
