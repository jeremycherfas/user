Strange goings on, possibly because I listened to a bunch of podcasts with the phone in Airplane Mode, a few epsidoes were marked as completed within the same minute, which my daggy Python program was not equipped to deal with. So, rather than mess about, here they are.

- [&#127911; 173. Olives!](https://soundcloud.com/nobadfoodpod/173-olives) I'm willing to give anything one listen, but too many giggles and not enough substance means No Bad Food goes nowhere.
- [&#127911; Song 172, Hickory Wind by the Byrds: Part 4, Hour of Darkness](https://huffduffer.com/JeremyCherfas/705097) Too nerdy even for me.
- [&#127911; Benedictus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0024vn6) Pretty sublime

I think I have solved the problem now by adding seconds to the slug for individual items, but with no flights planned, maybe that's overkill.
