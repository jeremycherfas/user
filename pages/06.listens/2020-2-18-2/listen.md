Episode summary: Could we really fix gridlock in the Senate by creating new states? Malcolm revisits the “Divide and Conquer” episode from Season 3 in an interview on Deep Background with Noah Feldman, the newest podcast from Pushkin Industries. “Divide and Conquer” covered Texas’s right to divide into 5 separate states. What if Washington, D.C. — a non-state territory — tried to divide their city into 127 separate states? A recent anonymous note in the Harvard Law Review proposes just that. It’s just the kind of bananas idea Malcolm loves to dissect, and Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law Professor and Constitutional law expert is the perfect foil. Noah’s podcast, Deep Background with Noah Feldman, is available wherever you get your podcasts.
