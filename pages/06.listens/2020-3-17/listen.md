Episode summary: A special extra episode with Rachel Bronson, president of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, about their decision to move the Doomsday Clock 20 seconds nearer to midnight, closer that itâ€™s ever been. She explains why the world is more dangerous now than even at the height of the Cold War and what are the risks that keep her awake at night. How close really are we to the end? Scary but essential listening. Recorded at the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. Extra listening: Aaron Rapport on Nuclear Weapons https://play.acast.com/s/talkingpolitics/db9732a4-8e39-4f8f-bb30-cf6f862036cf For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy
