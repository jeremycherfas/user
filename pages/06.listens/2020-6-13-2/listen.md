Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Music We hear Armellodie by Chilly Gonzales And All Now Vibe by Tara Jane O’Neil Notes The Lavender Scare by David K. Johnson Trouble in Lafayette Square by Gil Klein
