Episode summary: Season 5 of Revisionist History included four episodes on the rise of air power during the Second World War. Listeners met Air Force generals Haywood Hansell and Curtis LeMay and heard about the birth of napalm and the firebombing of Tokyo. Malcolm couldn’t get that story out of his mind, and so he built an entirely new audiobook around it. The Bomber Mafia. The Bomber Mafia thought they could re-invent war, in part because of a reclusive genius named Carl Norden. In this excerpt, you hear more about him and his game changing invention, the Norden Bombsight. If you loved those episodes, you’ll be in history heaven with The Bomber Mafia. It features more archival footage, new writing, and enhanced scoring. It’s a totally new experience. Purchase the audiobook at www.bombermafia.com, and you’ll receive a free Listener’s Guide featuring new commentary from Malcolm. Print and ebook editions available wherever books are sold.
