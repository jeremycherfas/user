Episode summary: Our episode with Justin Townes Earle was scheduled to run next month. But after we heard about Earle’s passing over the weekend, we decided to put it out sooner. It’s a deeply sad conversation in some places. Especially given his passing. However, it’s also incredibly soulful, funny and searching. And the performances, culled from Earle’s last release, The Saint of Lost Causes, are brilliant. Bruce Headlam takes the reigns this episode for what’s turned out to be a fitting tribute to one of the great, dynamic young performers and songwriters that’s now gone way too soon. Rest in peace, Justin Townes Earle [1982-2020].
