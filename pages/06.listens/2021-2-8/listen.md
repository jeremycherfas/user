Episode summary: In the summer of 2020, Bon Appétit faced an online reckoning. It imploded, seemingly overnight, former employees calling it a racist and toxic workplace. But the story of what actually happened there started ten years earlier. This is Chapter One, “Original Sin,” of our series The Test Kitchen. Here are some recipes to try from the people featured in this week’s story: Yewande Komolafe’s yam and plantain curry with crispy shallots and sheet-pan gochujang chicken. Sue Li’s caramelized onion galette and creamy turmeric pasta. Rick Martinez’s mole sencillo. Eleanore Park’s ginger-scallion meatballs with lemony farro. Also, you can read Rachel Premack’s breaking story on Bon Appétit from last summer here.
