Episode summary: When Laura Coates decided to become a prosecutor in Washington, D.C., she was told that the job would be &ldquo;human misery.&rdquo; She says she remembers thinking, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one person in the justice system who could do something about human misery, surely, it&rsquo;s the powerful prosecutor.&rdquo; After four years, she quit.
