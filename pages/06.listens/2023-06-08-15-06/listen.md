Episode summary: Gary Marcus and John Lanchester join David to discuss all things AI, from ChatGPT to the Turing test. Why is the Turing test such a bad judge of machine intelligence? If these machines aren&rsquo;t thinking, what is it they are doing? And what are we doing giving them so much power to shape our lives? Plus we discuss self-driving cars, the coming jobs apocalypse, how children learn, and what it is that makes us truly human.Gary&rsquo;s new podcast is Humans vs. Machines.Read Turing&rsquo;s original paper here. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.
