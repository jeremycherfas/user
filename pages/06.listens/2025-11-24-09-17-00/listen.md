Episode summary: Audio reporter Samantha Broun says young people are &ldquo;full of life, complicated, passionate, confused, and they want to talk and want to be heard.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why Sam offers them her curiosity and her caring ear for her project &ldquo;Small True Things.&rdquo; Rob spoke to Sam in October for Sound School on the mainstage at the annual Audio Festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
