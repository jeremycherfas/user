Episode summary: The night represents a slowing, quiet contemplation, autonomy, dreams … the dominion of rest. But Grind Culture tells us that our worth is in our productivity. The Nap Bishop is here to tell us, “No”. Rest is not a privilege, it’s a human right. Sleep deprivation is a social and racial justice issue. And, “Resting is actually going to allow you to wake up.”
