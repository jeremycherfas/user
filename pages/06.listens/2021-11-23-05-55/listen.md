Episode summary: In this episode of the Gravy podcast, &ldquo;Orange Juice and the Making of the Sunshine State,&rdquo; producer Katie Jane Fernelius examines how, for decades, the Florida Citrus Commission not only peddled orange juice, but Florida&rsquo;s popular image as the Sunshine State. To look into a glass of Florida orange juice is to look into the thorny mythologies of the state&mdash;and those who challenged the values those mythologies represented.
