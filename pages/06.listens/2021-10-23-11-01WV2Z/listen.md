Episode summary: A war. A ransom. And a stunning recovery mission. Five elaborately carved panels were buried in a New Zealand swamp to protect it from a war. Then 150 years later, they&rsquo;re acquired by a British collector before being sold to a Swiss-Bolivian collector in Geneva. And their long journey home began when a kidnap ransom payment had to be made. This is the remarkable story of the Motunui Epa. Season Two is co-produced with CBC Podcasts.
