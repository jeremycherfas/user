Episode summary: If moral philosophy is a train to crazy town, at what stop should we disembark?

I don’t think I heard an answer to this provocative question, but I did hear some things that I could not grasp. All this talk of “what if we’re living in a simulation” smacks to me of late nights in the dorm with bad weed and good cocoa, and yet here are _bona fide_ intellectuals giving the question their all, without even a snicker. That makes me think I must be missing the point. Maybe I am, but the truth is, I honestly don’t care. As for the rest of MacAskill’s ideas, I’m all in favour of effective altruism, but a lot less sure about population ethics, especially after reading [The New Moral Mathematics](https://bostonreview.net/articles/the-new-moral-mathematics/), a review by Kieran Setiya.
