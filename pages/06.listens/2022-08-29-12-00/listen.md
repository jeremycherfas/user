Episode summary: Citizens armed only with Molotov cocktails battle with Russian tanks on the streets of&hellip; Budapest. In November of 1956 Russian troops invaded Hungary. The revolution was crushed and thousands of Hungarians fled. Will history repeat itself? We talk with R&eacute;ka Pigniczky about her memory project, a film series dedicated to the Hungarian revolution. Also: Branko Marcetic compares America&rsquo;s response to the events of 1956 with our current posturing over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
