Episode summary: Shaken by the passing of his grandmother, George reflects on the post-colonial struggles of her generation. 1970s Jamaica provides an early case study of the weaponised debt that went on to re-colonise much of the global South. A look back on previous episodes illuminates patterns of exploitation and extraction across African/Western relations. This is the global context that frames the questionable role of the International Monetary Fund in the perpetuation of poverty. George is reminded by his grandmother&rsquo;s legacy that fighting for justice is always an option. Written by George the Poet Produced by Benbrick &amp; George the Poet With an original score composed by Benbrick and recorded by the BBC Concert Orchestra.
