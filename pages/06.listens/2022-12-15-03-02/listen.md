Episode summary: In February of 1910, members of the Music Hall Ladies Guild in London received a strange letter from their treasurer &ndash; a singer who went by the name Belle Elmore. It said that she suddenly had to travel to the United States, and that she was resigning from her position. Several weeks later, at the Music Hall Ladies Guild fundraising ball, Belle&rsquo;s husband arrived with a date. And she was wearing Belle&rsquo;s brooch.
