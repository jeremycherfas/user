Episode summary: The power of Western languages over African economies is undeniable, and nowhere is this more obvious than in Black music. Despite &ldquo;Francophone&rdquo; meaning French-speaking, across Africa, it signifies so much more. George looks at the power dynamics between the English-speaking world, the French-speaking world and the Africans forced to navigate both. How did these languages become so important? And what do they reveal about the legacy of colonialism? Written by George the Poet Produced by Benbrick &amp; George the Poet Original score composed by Benbrick and performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra
