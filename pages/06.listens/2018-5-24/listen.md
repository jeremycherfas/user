Episode summary: English performance artist and food scholar Amanda Couch reprises the ancient Mesopotamian art of liver divination, and tries to answer questions from mortality to Brexit by reading the lines and lobes on a sheep’s liver. “Chance, when you use it to make a composition or to make a decision to do something, it’s taking away from those enlightenment ideas of hierarchies of what art is and returning them back to where they were in prehistoric times when art objects were connected to ritualistic acts.” —- Ox Tales is produced by Anna Sigrithur and edited by Naomi Duguid and Fiona Sinclair with production help by Thomas Krause. Music by Thomas Krause and Ava Glendinning. Find out more by visiting our website at https://www.oxfordsymposium.org.uk/podcast/
