Episode summary: Sayre Quevedo is a producer at VICE. “I’m not like a cinephile at all but in a movie nobody says, ‘And then he revealed to me a deep, dark secret.’ You discover the deep, dark secret as the main character is learning it. And I just feel like there’s something so much more engaging for me as a listener to feel like I’m discovering at the same time as the person who’s doing the reporting than feeling like you’re just describing the process of discovery. I just need things to feel like they did in real life. I don’t want to recreate things.”
