Episode summary: Today&rsquo;s bad idea is about how ideas get adopted, argued over and rejected: David talks to political philosopher Alan Finlayson about what&rsquo;s wrong with seeing this as a competitive marketplace. From St. Paul to Citizens United, from John Stuart Mill to Jordan Peterson, what happens when ideas get turned into commodities? Who wins and who loses? And what is an &lsquo;ideological entrepreneur&rsquo;? Looking for Christmas presents?
