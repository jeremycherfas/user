Episode summary: In a tour de force solo performance, Natalie takes on Virgil&rsquo;s great poem in 28 minutes.. and wins.In 12 books of Latin verse we follow the hero, the Trojan Prince Aeneas, as he leads the survivors of Troy to found a new city in Italy. Along the way he battles vengeful Juno, tells of the Trojan Horse and the Fall of Troy, loves and leaves Dido in Carthage, enters Hades, eats some tables and then sees his ships turn into sea nymphs and swim away from attack. Then there is more fighting until our hero emerges triumphant.The poet Virgil died before finishing it and ordered it to be burned, but luckily his orders were disregarded by Augustus, the first Emperor of Rome, for whom The Aeneid was excellent propaganda. &lsquo;Rockstar mythologist&rsquo; Natalie Haynes is the best-selling author of &lsquo;Divine Might&rsquo;, &lsquo;Stone Blind&rsquo;, and &lsquo;A Thousand Ships&rsquo; as well as a reformed comedian who is a little bit obsessive about Ancient Greek and Rome.Producer&hellip;Beth O&rsquo;Dea
