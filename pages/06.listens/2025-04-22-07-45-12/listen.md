Episode summary: Authenticity. An idea that has plagued many conversations on food. This week, we are joined by Professor Ignacio M. S&aacute;nchez Prado, the Jarvis Thurston and Mona van Duyn Professor in Humanities at Washington University in St. Louis. We interrogate the role of authenticity in constructing Mexican national identity through another culinary idea: that of the taco. We discuss the taco&rsquo;s malleable history across regions, including Taco Bell. Stay tuned for Professor S&aacute;nchez Prado&rsquo;s upcoming book on the taco and modernity!
