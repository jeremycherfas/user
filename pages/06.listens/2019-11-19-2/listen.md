Episode summary: Two statistics about reducing your risk of an early death made headlines around the world recently. The first seems to be a great reason to add a four-legged friend to your life. It suggests that owning a dog is tied to lowering your chance of dying early by nearly a quarter. The second statistic claims that even a minimal amount of running is linked to reducing your risk of premature death by up to 30%. Ruth Alexander finds out whatâ€™s behind these numbers and we hear from epidemiologist, Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz. Producer: Darin Graham
