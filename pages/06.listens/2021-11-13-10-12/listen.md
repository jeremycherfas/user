Episode summary: Even if we think of the camera as a neutral technology, it is not. In the vast spectrum of human colors, photographic tools and practices tend to prioritize the lighter end of that range.

So interesting to listen to this immedately after seeing The Harder They Fall on Netflix last night. All the Black faces looked great, with many different shades of “Black”. So much so that I did not give it a second thought. Now of course I want to back and watch it again, but not too immediately. It would also pay to watch in particular the scenes in the White town — a glorious visual joke. My recollection is that the White people were indeed very pale and very clean.
