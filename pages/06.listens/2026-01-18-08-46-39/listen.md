Episode summary: This hour long special celebrates a quarter of a century of the programme and charts the course of a human life through pieces of music. Cerys Matthews introduces a compilation of some of the diverse pieces of music we&rsquo;ve featured throughout the years - together with stories of the people whose lives have been changed by it. Everything from Satie&rsquo;s Gymnopedies and Vaughan Williams&rsquo; The Lark Ascending to Wichita Lineman by Glen Campbell and Computer Love by Kraftwerk.Stories of birth, childhood, adolescence, as well as the griefs and joys of adulthood are expressed through the music that shapes and sustains us through the emotional ups and downs of our lives&rsquo; journeys. Producer: Maggie Ayre
