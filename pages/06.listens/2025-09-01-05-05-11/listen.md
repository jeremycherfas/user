Episode summary: For nearly a decade beekeepers around the world have been saying that there&rsquo;s something very wrong with the honey industry. Prices are down, and so is production, but there&rsquo;s more honey being sold than ever before. So what exactly is in that jar in your kitchen cupboard?
