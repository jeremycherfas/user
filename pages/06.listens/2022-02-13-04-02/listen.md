Episode summary: It&rsquo;s May 1945 and Germany has just surrendered. The country is in chaos &ndash; a million former soldiers, three million foreign nationals, another million liberated from the concentration camps, all trying to get home. And hiding somewhere, in all that, hoping to slip away, are the top Nazis. Top of the list to be tracked down and arrested are Joachim von Ribbentrop (Hitler&rsquo;s Foreign Minister), Ernst Kaltenbrunner (Himmler&rsquo;s Deputy), Hans Frank (Governor of Occupied Poland) and maybe even Martin Bormann (Hitler&rsquo;s closest aide). Once caught, they are corralled in a stripped-out hotel in Luxembourg. But former Reichsmarschall Goering doesn&rsquo;t have to be found: he surrenders himself along with 16 monogrammed suitcases, varnished nails and a valet. Starring Elliot Cowan as Sergeant Monelli, US Army Sergeant and Nigel Lindsay as Hermann Goering, one-time head of the Luftwaffe. Cast: Sergeant Monelli - ELLIOT COWAN Colonel Burton Andrus - JOSEPH ALESSI Hermann Goering - NIGEL LINDSAY Agent Matteson and other roles -&hellip;

Somewhat too “dramatic” — like when they try to stop Himmler swallowing the cyanide in his capsule — but interesting for all that. I expect it will get better as the physical drama decreases.
