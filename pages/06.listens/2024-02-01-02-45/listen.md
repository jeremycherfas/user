Episode summary: THE ENGLISH: Laurie Taylor asks how the country house became &lsquo;English&rsquo; and explores changing notions of Englishness over the past 60 years. He&rsquo;s joined by Stephanie Barczewski, Professor of Modern British History at Clemson University, South Carolina and author of a new book which examines the way the country house came to embody national values of continuity and stability, even though it has lived through eras of violence and disruption. Also, David Matless, Professor of Cultural Geography at Nottingham University, considers the way that England has been imagined since the 1960s, from politics to popular culture, landscape and music. How have twenty-first-century concerns and anxieties in the Brexit moment been moulded by events over previous decades?Producer: Jayne Egerton
