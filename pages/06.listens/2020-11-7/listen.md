Episode summary: Bruce Springsteen is a national treasure. Since his debut album nearly 50 years ago, Springsteen has helped define the American working-class psyche through a collection of world-renowned hit songs. In this interview with Malcolm Gladwell and Rick Rubin, Bruce talks about how listening to Born To Run 45 years after it was released made him realize just how good he really is. He also talks about how his Irish and Italian sides physically manifest into songs, and how he recorded his stellar new album, Letter To You, live with the E Street Band in just four days.
