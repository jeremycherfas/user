Episode summary: The life of musician Connie Converse easily reduces down to one of those Hemingway length sad stories: Before Dylan there was Connie Converse and then she disappeared. In his new book &ldquo;To Anyone Who Ever Asks: The Life, Music, and Mystery of Connie Converse&rdquo; Howard Fishman gives us the complete tale. We meet up with Howard and learn why this incredible musician just couldn&rsquo;t catch a break in 1950s New York City, and why he is devoted to her life and art. You can get a copy of Howard&rsquo;s amazing book wherever books are sold or use this link
