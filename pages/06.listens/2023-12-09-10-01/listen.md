Episode summary: In the 1950s poodles were all the rage &mdash; one tabloid even reported that when a girl &ldquo;makes the big time she traditionally acquires 3 things &mdash; minks, gems, and a poodle.&rdquo; But one poodle in particular put the breed on the map. His name was Masterpiece&hellip; and police in 13 states knew exactly what he looked like. This episode originally aired in 2018.
