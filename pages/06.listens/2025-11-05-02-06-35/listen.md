Episode summary: In today&rsquo;s episode the two Davids try to answer some of the hundreds of questions, comments and suggestions we have had in response to this series, ranging from the very broad to the very specific. How do we know if democracy is broken? Have we ever had a real democracy anyway? Should old people be banned from voting? Or should we simply ban the internet instead? Plus much, much more. Out tomorrow on PPF+: A bonus episode with more questions on how to fix democracy and more answers from the two Davids. Should MPs be chosen by lottery? What has happened to the centre-right?
