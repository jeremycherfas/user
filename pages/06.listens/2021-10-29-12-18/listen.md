Episode summary: They&rsquo;ve seen wars, the bottom of the ocean and even - bizarrely - been part of a boxing match. The story of how the Parthenon Marbles actually ended up in London&rsquo;s British Museum is a wild tale featuring bribes, court cases and some extremely dodgy deals. There&rsquo;s been a centuries-long campaign to get them back to their homeland. Now, a team of Greek-Australians have decided that the time for diplomacy is over and a new tactic is required. Season Two is co-produced with CBC Podcasts.
