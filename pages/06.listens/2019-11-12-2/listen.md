Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Anyway… Music Inside River, Pt. 1 by Akira Kosuemura. . Sonata for Solo Cello 1: Dialogo by Ligeti, performed by Miklos Perenyi. All the Land Ablaze by Laura Cannell Frost Trees from Lalo Schiffren’s score to The Fox. And Finding the Flag from Georges Delarue’s score to The Day of the Dolphin.
