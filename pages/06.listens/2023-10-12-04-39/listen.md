Episode summary: Since its rise to international acclaim, the multi-award-winning &ldquo;Have You Heard George&rsquo;s Podcast?&rdquo; has remained famously undefinable. In its explosive new season, however, this finally changes, as George the Poet pieces together fragments of the African and Caribbean independence struggles. Poignant tales of strength and sacrifice frame some of the most important yet least discussed events of the last six decades, from the perspective of history&rsquo;s unsung heroes. George&rsquo;s verses flow over an evocative soundtrack, composed by long-time collaborator Benbrick, and brought to life by the BBC Concert Orchestra in Abbey Road. The season is peppered with timeless music from all corners of Black life - from Africa to the Caribbean and beyond. The fourth season of HYHGP? brings to light the hidden tragedies and triumphs that have shaped our world.
