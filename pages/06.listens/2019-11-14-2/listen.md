Episode summary: In 1977, a man named Robert Burns went to a funeral and shot someone, in the head, in front of 300 people. He didn’t deny it, and his lawyer didn’t deny it. Burns told a police officer: “I had to do it. And if I had to do it over, I’d do it again.” Casey Cep’s book is The Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee.
