Story editor: Loretta Williams. Music by Michelle Osis, Lilli Haydn, Chris Westlake, Alex Symcox, and Goodnight, Lucas. Music consulting by Joe Augustine of Narrative Music. Art by Gergo Varga and Harper Biewen. &ldquo;Capitalism&rdquo; is a production of the Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University, in partnership with Imperative 21.
