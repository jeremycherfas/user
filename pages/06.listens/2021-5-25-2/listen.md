Episode summary: The C13Originals Peabody nominated series is back for Season Three: Jerry Falwell Jr. and Liberty University. A sex scandal rocks one of the worldâ€™s largest Christian universities, and the man at the center of it. But that scandal is just the beginning. The award-winning Gangster Capitalism team spoke with more than 80 former and current Liberty students, faculty, staff, high-ranking administrators, and those with intimate knowledge of Falwell Jr. What emerges is the inside story of how the university, and the family who founded it, have been rocked by power, greed, hypocrisy, and of course money.
