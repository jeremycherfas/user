Episode summary: As the war in Ukraine continues, Reuters has reported that some 2.3 million people have been displaced. So far many of those have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. The UN estimates that as of the 8th of march Poland has taken in almost 1.3 million refugees, Hungary just over 200,000 and Slovakia almost 100,000. In comparison the UK has issued visa&rsquo;s to just under 1000 people. Some say this isn&rsquo;t enough, however, Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the governments record claiming that &lsquo;&rdquo;We&rsquo;ve done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015.&rdquo; Sound familiar? Join us on a journey back to 2020 to find out whether this is accurate or just a repeated misleading claim.
