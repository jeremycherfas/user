Episode summary: Help support this show and the network that makes it possible by making a donation today. Make your mark at Radiotopia.fm/donate A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Music Field of Reeds by Leo Svirsky. Stellify by Federico Albanese. Opening by Nathanial Bartlett. Turning 16 by Ben Sollee. Notes I strongly recommend checking out Annelise Orlick’s Common Sense and a Little Fire, an exhilarating history of Pauline Newman, Rose Schneiderman and other women at the center of the labor movement in the 20th Century.
