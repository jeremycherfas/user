Episode summary: Maciej Ceglowski is not just the founder of one of the indie web&rsquo;s success stories &mdash; the modest yet long-running subscription bookmarking service Pinboard &mdash; but a prolific commentator on the world the Internet is helping to create. This week, we&rsquo;re thrilled to chat with Maciej about reimagining not just the Internet, but the stakes that the people using the Internet are responding to.
