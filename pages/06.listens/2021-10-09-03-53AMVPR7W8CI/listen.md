Episode summary: She might be best known as the colourfully clad host of the Great British Bake Off, but Dame Prue Leith&rsquo;s accomplishments during her six decades in the food industry are vast and varied. She&rsquo;s enjoyed success as a cook, restaurateur, businesswoman, broadcaster, campaigner, food writer and novelist; and in conversation with Sheila Dillon, on a balmy summer afternoon on the terrace of her Cotswolds home, Prue shares the lessons she&rsquo;s learned from her career so far. We also hear from Prue&rsquo;s niece Peta Leith, a pastry chef and food writer with whom she recently collaborated on the book &lsquo;The Vegetarian Kitchen&rsquo; - and from Dr Rupy Aujla, the NHS GP who started the Culinary Medicine UK programme teaching doctors to cook, and creator of the podcast &lsquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; linking better health to good cooking and eating, who is Prue&rsquo;s co-host on the television series &lsquo;Cook Clever, Waste Less&rsquo;. Presented by Sheila Dillon Produced by Lucy Taylor in Bristol
