Episode summary: This week&rsquo;s Great Political Fiction is Ivan Turgenev&rsquo;s Fathers and Sons (1862), the definitive novel about the politics &ndash; and emotions &ndash; of intergenerational conflict. How did Turgenev manage to write a wistful novel about nihilism? What made Russian politics in the early 1860s so chock-full of frustration? Why did Turgenev&rsquo;s book infuriate his contemporaries &ndash; including Dostoyevsky?More from the LRB:Pankaj Mishra on the disillusionment of Alexander Herzen &lsquo;&ldquo;Emancipation&rdquo;, he concluded, &ldquo;has finally proved to be as insolvent as redemption&rdquo;.&rsquo;Julian Barnes on Turgenev and Flaubert &lsquo;When the two of them meet, they are already presenting themselves as elderly men in their early forties (Turgenev asserts that after 40 the basis of life is renunciation).&rsquo; Hosted on Acast.
