Episode summary: In our last episode we spoke Cecilia Gentili, a trans Latina who worked for many years as an undocumented sex worker. Today, we get two more views of sex work in America. We speak with a high-end escort in New York City, and take a trip to one of the only legal brothels in the country - the Bunny Ranch. Criminal is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX.
