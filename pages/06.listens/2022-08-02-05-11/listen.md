Episode summary: There is a cave in the middle of the Mojave Desert called Devil&rsquo;s Hole. It&rsquo;s home to a small iridescent blue fish, called the Devil&rsquo;s Hole pupfish - and you can&rsquo;t find them anywhere else in the world. There are fences, cameras, and motion sensors for security. In 2016, three men rammed the fences and broke in. We need your help.
