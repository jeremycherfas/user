Episode summary: It is impossible to avoid the past in Rome; indeed, the past is why so many people come to Rome. If you&rsquo;re interested in the history of food, though, there&rsquo;s been nothing to see since the pasta museum shut its doors, aside from a few restaurants resting on their laurels. A new museum, at the bottom of the Palatine Hill and facing the chariot-racing stadium, has put food history back on the tourist map. I was very fortunate to get a guided tour from the director, Matteo Ghirighini, a few days before Garum, as it is called, opened its doors to the public. I learned so much, including the French origins of a Roman street food and the most convincing origin story yet for perhaps the most contentious pasta dish. Notes * The museum&rsquo;s website is packed with information about the place and a growing list of food history stories. * Transcript coming right up. * All photos by me. Huffduff it
