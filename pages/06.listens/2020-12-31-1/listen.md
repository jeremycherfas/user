Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX. A note on notes: We’d much rather you just went into each episode of The Memory Palace cold. And just let the story take you where it well. So, we don’t suggest looking into the show notes first. Music Waltz for Sky by Muriel Botsdorp A Gathering to Lead me When You’re Gone by Brian McBride 20 (Lichen) by Brendan Eder Ensemble Electronium Movie Score by Raymond Scott Someday We’ll Linger in the Sun by Gaelynn Lea 32 (Harp) by Nearly Oratorio Notes By far the most fun and helpful thing I read for this episode was Michael O’Malley’s, Keeping Watch: A History of American Time. ﻿
