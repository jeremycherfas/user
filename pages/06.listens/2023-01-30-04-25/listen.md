Episode summary: Like so many of us, Dan Saladino knows he needs to be in better shape, but why do his attempts to make a change keep failing? There&rsquo;s one important question he needs to resolve, when it comes to diet, are his family helping or hindering his eating habits? In his search for better health in 2023, Dan is joined by Dr Michael Mosley, inventor of the 5:2 diet, keto coach Panagiotis Kottas and the Whitingtons, the family behind the television documentary &ldquo;Fixing Dad&rdquo; in which two sons stepped in to save their father from a steep decline after a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. Produced and presented by Dan Saladino.
