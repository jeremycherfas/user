Episode summary: When Antony Easton&rsquo;s enigmatic father passes away, he begins sorting through a suitcase filled with cryptic family clues. Neatly stacked German money, a family tree stretching back generations, and books filled with sprawling notes. He also finds his father&rsquo;s birth certificate, but bearing a different name. Confronting his dad&rsquo;s double identity, Antony begins a ten-year quest to uncover the truth. Piece-by-piece he comes to understand his family&rsquo;s dark history. Large numbers of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis and a vast fortune was stolen from his grandparents - factories, property and art - which now lie scattered across Germany. Antony is determined to find the descendants of those who looted his family&rsquo;s assets and continue to live off their wealth today. He sets out to meet them face to face.
