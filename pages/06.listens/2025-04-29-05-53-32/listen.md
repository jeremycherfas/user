Episode summary: Recently, the White House announced its plans to ask Congress to rescind funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. If the plan passes, there could be serious consequences for the public media ecosystem. Rather than tell you why we think public media is important, we are sharing this piece from NPR&rsquo;s Up First. This story is one of the best things we&rsquo;ve listened to this year, so we think you&rsquo;ll enjoy it, just because. We also think it&rsquo;ll show you, a thousand times better than we can tell you, about why public media is essential. Kudos to The Sunday Story team at NPR for this magnificent piece.
