Episode summary: After a 17-hour-long interrogation, a woman confesses to a murder. But then, evidence surfaces proving that she can&rsquo;t have actually done it &ndash; and that it was a false confession. Today, we&rsquo;re looking at what goes on in an interrogation room &ndash; and hear a recording from inside. Maurice Chammah and the Marshall Project released a 6-part podcast series about James Holland and Larry Driskill &ndash; it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Smoke Screen: Just Say You&rsquo;re Sorry.&rdquo; Say hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
