Episode summary: Writing like it&rsquo;s a television drama complete with instructions for a camera operator. That&rsquo;s an unusual maneuver for a podcast. One I&rsquo;d never heard before. Neither had Susan Burton until she wrote that way herself in the latest season of The Retrievals, a production from Serial and The New York Times.
