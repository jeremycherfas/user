Episode summary: On a Saturday night, in February 1949, the music programming on one of the most popular radio stations in Quito, Ecuador, was interrupted with an urgent news bulletin: strange objects in the sky that looked like large disks with bright lights were using a powerful ray to destroy a nearby city. And they were heading right for Quito. Thanks to Lisette Ar&eacute;valo for sharing her tape and her reporting. In 2020, she reported this story for the Spanish-language podcast Radio Ambulante &ndash; it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Extraterrestrials.&rdquo; You can listen at https://radioambulante.org/en/audio-en/the-extraterrestrials.
