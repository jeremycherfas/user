Episode summary: Deep in the cellars of one of England&rsquo;s grandest country homes, covered in dirt and cobwebs, lay dozens of bottles of ancient rum. Their discovery set off a frenzy among collectors vying to own the oldest rum in the world. But where did they come from and who produced them? Sealed inside was the story of an enslaved people in one of the first overseas colonies of the British Empire - Barbados. This podcast is a co-production of ABC Australia and CBC Podcasts.
