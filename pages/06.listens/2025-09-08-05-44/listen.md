Episode summary: NPR&rsquo;s Robert Smith says when he&rsquo;s writing and gets to the end of a story he has empty pockets. He&rsquo;s used all the good stuff and left nothing for the end. To combat that problem, Robert studied endings from some of his favorite reporters and put together a list of categories that broadly describe memorable story endings.
