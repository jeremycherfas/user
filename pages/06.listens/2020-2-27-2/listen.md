Episode summary: “The police had surrounded the house. They had been there for quite a while. They didn’t want to try to rush the house because they thought he might kill one of the innocent people. But after waiting for a long time, I asked the police: ‘Let me see if I can talk to the guy.’” Thanks to CBC Licensing. Criminal is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX.
