Episode summary: Today&rsquo;s episode is about a momentous trial and the incendiary book that followed: the trial was of Adolf Eichmann, convicted by an Israeli court in 1961 of orchestrating the Holocaust, and the book was Hannah Arendt&rsquo;s Eichmann in Jerusalem (1963), which questioned the grounds on which he was prosecuted. What did Arendt mean by &lsquo;the banality of evil&rsquo;? Why was she convinced that the case against Eichmann was badly misjudged? Was the trial really intended to serve as a history lesson? And if it was, what was it designed to teach? Next time in Politics on Trial: Nelson Mandela vs Apartheid Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices
