Episode summary: Emily Oster is an economist, professor, and author.

And it affects how I think about what I write, and I would like what I write to be the things that I think are true, not the things I think will avoid people being angry.&rdquo; Show notes: @ProfEmilyOster emilyoster.net &ldquo;Steve Cohen-Backed Radkl Hires DeFi Trader Aaron Lammer&rdquo; (Nick Baker &bull; Bloomberg &bull; Nov 2021) Expecting Better (Penguin Books &bull; 2014) Cribsheet (Penguin Books &bull; 2020) The Family Firm (Penguin Books &bull; 2021) Oster&rsquo;s Parent Data newsletter 35:00 &rdquo;Antibiotics and Allergies, Zika, Travel Baby Carriers&hellip;&rdquo; (Parent Data &bull; Feb 2020) 36:00 &rdquo;Grandparents &amp; Day Care&rdquo; (Parent Data &bull; May 2020) 36:00 &rdquo;She Fought to&hellip;
