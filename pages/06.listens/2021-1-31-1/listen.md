Episode summary: Qandeel Baloch grew up in a conservative village in Pakistan, a place where it was shocking to see a woman swimming outdoors. She ran away from home, changed her name, and eventually became “Pakistan’s first social media star.” By 2015, she was reported to be one of the 10 most Googled people in Pakistan. The next year, she was dead. Sanam Maher’s book is A Woman Like Her: The Story Behind the Honor Killing of a Social Media Star. Criminal is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX.
