Episode summary: This month, we asked the Radiotopians about their guilty pleasures — the things they secretly enjoy but would rather not tell anyone about (except for all of you, of course). In this episode you’ll hear: Joe Richman, Manoush Zomorodi, Jen Poyant, Jonathan Mitchell, Phoebe Judge, Lauren Spohrer, Roman Mars, Neil Katcher, Dave Nadelberg, Benjamen Walker, Helen Zaltzman, Ian Chillag and Nate DiMeo. Now, it’s your turn. Head over to the Radiotopia Citizens Facebook Group and let’s talk about guilty pleasures. No shame! Only love.
