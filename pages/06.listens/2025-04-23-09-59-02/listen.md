Episode summary: Rick Easton is co-owner of Bread and Salt Bakery in Jersey City, New Jersey. He&rsquo;s also the coauthor of a fascinating new cookbook, Bread and How to Eat It, which he wrote with his partner, the great journalist Melissa McCart. On this episode, we talk about Rick&rsquo;s love of baking, sandwiches, and not following convention. We also find out how working in Italy informed his unique style that has made Bread and Salt one of the region&rsquo;s most beloved spots. We hope you enjoy learning more about Rick Easton. Also on the show, Aliza and Matt are joined by producers Pat and Shalea for a sandwich draft. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s an NBA-style snake draft, separating the BLTs from the PB&amp;Js. Where will the Italian hoagie land? Will avocado toast be left waiting to be picked?
