Episode summary: I have been following Jess&rsquo;s work ever since I heard Bats in the Attic on BBC Shortcuts. Jess so artfully integrates two weaving strands of a story together to create a 7-minute piece which is moving, poetic and challenging. The way Jess deals with grief - with curiosity and even humour - is so powerful. We spoke to Jess about Bats in the Attic and her programme Unchained which explores the impact of short term prison sentences on women&rsquo;s lives. You can listen to the episode here. If you want to think more deeply about some of the ideas presented in this episode, Jess has offered these links as a place to start: https://www.womeninprison.org.uk/campaigns/our-campaigns https://abolitionistfutures.com/ https://jessielawson.org/2019/09/01/we-are-incredible-producer/ https://www.instagram.com/lady_unchained/ https://twitter.com/paula_harriott https://twitter.com/AmandaJHailes &mdash;- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/telling-stories/message
