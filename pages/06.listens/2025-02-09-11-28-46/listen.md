Episode summary: Today&rsquo;s episode in our history of revolutionary ideas is about a medieval movement that used the ancient past to rethink and reimagine the present and the future. David talks to historian Eric Nelson about humanism and its enormous impact on the history of ideas. How did humanism emerge out of catastrophe? What did it do to the hold of Church and Empire on the medieval mind? Was humanist politics really revolutionary politics? And where is the &lsquo;human&rsquo; in humanism? As part of our Great Political Films series we are hosting a special screening of Network (1976) at the Regent Street Cinema in London on 18th March, followed by a live podcast recording with David and Helen Lewis. Aaron Sorkin said: &lsquo;No predictor of the future &ndash; not even Orwell &ndash; has ever been as right as Network.&rsquo; Come see why!
