Episode summary: Before Nigeria took over the African music scene, the Democratic Republic of Congo had us in a chokehold. But just like its minerals, the country&rsquo;s music has yet to produce an industry that eases the economic suffering of its people, despite decades of supply and demand. Why? George goes to the genesis of the DRC&rsquo;s economic reality by exploring the rise of Patrice Lumumba, Congo&rsquo;s first prime minister. Written by George The Poet Produced by Benbrick and George The Poet Original music by Benbrick, performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra. Sound Design by Benbrick.
