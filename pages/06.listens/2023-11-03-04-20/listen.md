Episode summary: Jack Barsky was a college student in 1970 when the KGB knocked on the door of his dorm room to inquire about his plans after college. &ldquo;I was told to broaden my knowledge of culture, of literature, of music, to become a well-educated person who could operate in higher strata of society.&rdquo; Jack Barsky wrote a book about his life. It&rsquo;s called Deep Undercover: My Secret Life and Tangled Allegiances as a KGB Spy in America. Criminal is going back on tour in February! We&rsquo;ll be telling brand new stories, live on stage.
