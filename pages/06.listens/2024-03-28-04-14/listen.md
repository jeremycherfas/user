Episode summary: In 1959, Anti-Americanism surged in the UK. England seethed over America&rsquo;s treatment of its Prime Minister who was smacked down for daring to use diplomacy to resolve the crisis over divided Germany. In 1959 England also fretted over a new American export: the Beatnik. The British foreign office forcefully responded with a report advocating for &ldquo; an increased effort in the field of press, radio and television in the U.K. to say the right kind of things about the Americans.&rdquo; This is the very moment Kenneth Tynan was commissioned to make a documentary for British Television about American Non-conformism and Dissent. We take a close look at one of the Cold War&rsquo;s most bizarre and inspired artifacts of Anti Anti-American propaganda. Shownotes: Laura Bradley writes on Brecht and German theater. Kenneth Tynan&rsquo;s documentary aired on January 27th, 1960 and then was supposedly erased (it wasn&rsquo;t).
