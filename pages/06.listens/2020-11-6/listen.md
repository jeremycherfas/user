Episode summary: David talks to Roberto Foa about his recent report into young peopleâ€™s attitude to democracy around the world. Why are millennials so much less satisfied with democratic politics than older generations? Can populist politics do anything to alter that? And what does the generation divide tell us about changing attitudes to Trump? Plus we discuss the generational politics of climate change, education and wealth inequality.

This was an interesting follow up to the earlier episode, although I wish Runciman had pressed him to reconcile huge younger-person support for Trump and huge younger-person support for urgent action on climate change. Different groups of younger persons, I suppose. Also, saved an hour of my life by not bothering to listen to the morning-after show on the US election. Can there possibly have been anything worth saying, beyond polling is seriously borken?
