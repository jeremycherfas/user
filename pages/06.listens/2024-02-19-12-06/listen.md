Episode summary: In May 1991, a bank robber walked into a bank in Irving, Texas, and without speaking handed the teller a note that read, &ldquo;This is a bank robbery. Give me your money. No marked bills or dye packs.&rdquo; Check out Skip Hollandsworth&rsquo;s Texas Monthly article, &ldquo;The Last Ride of Cowboy Bob.&rdquo; This episode was first released in 2020.
