Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Music Illusion Perdida by Juan Bautista Guido y Su Orquesta Tipico Manny Returns Home and Fingerprints from Bernard Herrmann’s score to The Wrong Man. Niggun for Solo Bassoon Phillipe Hersant Rearranging Furniture by Gabriel Yared Viona’s Lullaby by Peter Sandberg Notes The archives of the Kansas Historical Quarterly were very useful, particularly this article.
