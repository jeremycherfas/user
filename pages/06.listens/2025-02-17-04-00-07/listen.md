Episode summary: Today&rsquo;s episode is about a revolution that took centuries to happen if it ever really happened at all: The Scientific Revolution. David talks to historian of science Simon Schaffer about what changed in human understanding &ndash; and what didn&rsquo;t &ndash; in the age of Galileo and Newton. Was the new science a revolution of ideas or of practices? What did it mean for the hold of religious and political authority? Who or what were the driving forces behind it? And did the people who lived through it realise what was happening? 

A _tour de force_, I'm sure, but I feel as if Simon Schaffer has just bludgeoned me senseless with a 2Ã—4.
