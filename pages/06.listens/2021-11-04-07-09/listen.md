Episode summary: In County Cork, Ireland, there&rsquo;s a tree that locals call the Chalice Tree. Local lore says it&rsquo;s where British Redcoats disrupted a secret Catholic mass, killed two priests and took a sacred chalice. Now that chalice sits in London&rsquo;s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. But what happened in the intervening 200 years is now being pieced together by two Irish families: the O&rsquo;Keeffes and the McAulliffe&rsquo;s. Season Two is co-produced with CBC Podcasts.
