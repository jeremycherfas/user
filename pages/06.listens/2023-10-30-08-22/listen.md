Episode summary: With enemies lurking in every corner, Patrice Lumumba is trapped in his own home. As the first democratically elected prime minister of the Congo, he planned to use the country&rsquo;s natural wealth to improve the lives of its people, but secret actions by the US and Belgian governments stopped that from happening. These actions give a small indication of how far empires will go to hold onto power. Written by George the Poet Produced by Benbrick and George the poet Original Score by Benbrick, recorded by the BBC Concert Orchestra Sound Design by Benbrick.
