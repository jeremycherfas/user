Episode summary: We investigate Oxfam&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;since 2020, the five richest men in the world have seen their fortunes more than double, while almost five billion people have seen their wealth fall&rdquo;. With the help of Johan Norberg, Historian and Author of ideas and Felix Salmon, Financial Correspondent at Axios, we explore the figures behind the wealth of the richest and uncover what it really tells us about the world&rsquo;s financial markets. And Charles Kenny, senior fellow at the Centre for Global Development in Washington DC, helps us unpick why, when looking at the world&rsquo;s poorest people, measurements of wealth don&rsquo;t always tell us what we really need to know.
