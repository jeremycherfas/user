Episode summary: Jeremiah Moss&rsquo;s Feral City is much much more than a Covid memoir. In many ways it is a continuation of his desire to understand how and why New York city has changed, and if there is still a place for outsiders or if it now belongs to what he calls &ldquo;the new people.&rdquo; We walked around our Neighborhood together to talk about what the city was like during Covid time and what the phrase &ldquo;go back to normal&rdquo; really means.
