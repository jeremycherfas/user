Episode summary: If you&rsquo;re just beginning in audio storytelling or have some experience under your belt, you could toil alone making and making and making stories hoping to get better.

For inspiration, listen to the story Champika Fernando produced at a Workshop this summer. And be sure to listen for the surprising maneuver they pulled at the end of the piece.
