Episode summary: September 1945. Everyone is gathering in Nuremberg for the &lsquo;Trial Of The Century&rsquo; except the courtroom isn&rsquo;t ready, the judges are still in Berlin and none of the Nazis have lawyers &ndash; and exactly who will be formally accused? It&rsquo;s the last few weeks before the trial: who will actually be indicted? The names keep changing &ndash; and there are still some surprises&hellip;and blunders. And will the courtroom be rebuilt on time? It doesn&rsquo;t help when the floor collapses. And who will actually serve the indictments on the defendants? Major Neave, fluent German-speaker and first man to escape from Colditz, is tasked with serving the indictments.
