Episode summary: Raynor Winn&rsquo;s new memoir Landlines is a story that begins in fear but ends in hope. As the health of Moth, Raynor&rsquo;s husband, declines, the couple set out to walk the gruelling, remote and stunningly beautiful terrain of Scotland&rsquo;s Cape Wrath Trail, reflecting on community and the environment along the way. Raynor is the bestselling author of the astonishing, multi-award-winning The Salt Path (2019) which told the story of another remarkable journey, when nature first saved the couple. Just days after Raynor learnt that Moth, her husband of thirty-two years, was terminally ill, their home was taken away and they lost their livelihood. With nothing left and little time, they made the impulsive, brave decision to walk the 630 miles of the sea-swept South West Coast Path. &lsquo;You feel the world is a better place because Raynor and Moth are in it&rsquo; - The Times 5x15 brings together five outstanding individuals to tell of their lives, passions and inspirations. There are only two rules - no scripts and only 15 minutes&hellip;
