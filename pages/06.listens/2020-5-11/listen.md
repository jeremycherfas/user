Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Music We hear a couple from Alabaster DePlume’s To Cy & Lee album, Whisky Story Time and Not My Ask. Bibio’s CAPEL BETHANIA. The Sage, by the Chico Hamilton Quintet. The Last Tears of a Deceased by Emahoy Tsegue-Maryam Guebrou. Too Small for Eyes by Mothers.
