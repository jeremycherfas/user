Episode summary: The overlooked Olympian who was the resolutely unmarried goddess of the hearth and home. In fact, Zeus awarded her a glorious gift for remaining unmarried, a tradition Natalie very much feels should be continued. In Hestia&rsquo;s Roman form of Vesta her Vestal Virgins guarded the sacred flame in her temple. Edith Hall thinks she&rsquo;s like Nigella, a domestic goddess, which may explain why references to her are hard to find, but that her importance both to men and women at the time cannot be overestimated. &lsquo;Rockstar mythologist&rsquo; Natalie Haynes is the best-selling author of &lsquo;Divine Might&rsquo;, &lsquo;Stone Blind&rsquo;, and &lsquo;A Thousand Ships&rsquo; as well as a reformed comedian who is a little bit obsessive about Ancient Greek and Rome.Edith Hall is Professor of Classics at Durham University, specialising in ancient Greek literature. She has written over thirty books and is a Fellow of the British Academy.Producer&hellip;Beth O&rsquo;Dea
