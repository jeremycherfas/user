Episode summary: I’ve been thinking about fear, and movement, and exploration, and safety. I’ve been thinking about barriers, and perimeters - those we create and those that are imposed. Pushing yourself into fear on purpose gives some comfort that maybe you’ll be able to navigate life when you really have no control, when your thrown into a darkness bigger and deeper than you would ever choose.
