Episode summary: Today we meet &ldquo;Genius Grant&rdquo; winner Andrea Armstrong. In 2019, she started the Incarceration Transparency Project to identify and make public how many people were dying behind bars in Louisiana. The project also documents conditions inside the state&rsquo;s prisons and jails &ndash; what Andrea Armstrong calls &ldquo;secretive spaces of confinement.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s said: &ldquo;Too often, the how and why a person in prison dies is kept secret from everyone, including the person&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; Criminal is going back on tour in February!
