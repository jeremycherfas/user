Episode summary: For years Lucy Kellaway&rsquo;s life was the model of success- a columnist at the Financial Times, married to the same husband for decades, she appeared happy with an outwardly enviable life. But she began to realise that the life she had built for herself no longer suited her. Her book, Re-educated: How I changed my job, my home, my husband and my hair is a celebration of education&rsquo;s power to transform lives, an exploration of our schools today, and a reminder that there can be new beginnings at any age. &lsquo;Everyone over 50 needs to read this bracing and inspirational book&rsquo; - Nigella Lawson.
