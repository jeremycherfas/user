Episode summary: Jackie Morris is an author and illustrator. The Lost Words, which she wrote with Robert Macfarlane, won the 2019 Kate Greenaway Medal for distinguished illustration, and she was nominated for the same award in 2021 for The Unwinding, her &lsquo;book for dreamers&rsquo;. FEATHER, LEAF, BARK &amp; STONE is a pillow book of more than 100 short poems and meditations, typed onto gold leaf, leaves, bark and feathers. Written in the wake of Morris&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s death, it grew out of her grief, and was guided by her deep intimacy with the natural world. The result is an exquisite book full of the light and wind of the Pembrokeshire coast where it was crafted: poetry re-imagined by a visual artist.
