Episode summary: In April of 1995, wildlife biologists flew small airplanes over Yellowstone National Park, looking for two missing wolves. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just gone. And that&rsquo;s implausible because wolves don&rsquo;t just disappear.&rdquo; Thomas McNamee&rsquo;s book is The Killing of Wolf Number Ten. This episode was originally released in 2020.
