Episode summary: We now have many ways to tell the story of America&rsquo;s tilt towards authoritarianism, but for your host one image sums up the whole sordid business: a mashup of Donald Trump and the Marvel comic book character The Punisher. In this episode we talk with Kent Worcester, author of a new cultural history of the Punisher. It&rsquo;s a conversation about America&rsquo;s fascination with, and attraction to, a black and white vision of justice and vengeance.
