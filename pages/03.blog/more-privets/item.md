Two weeks ago, news of a weird search for “[free animal privets](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/what-the/)”. Today, someone is on the hunt for “sow girls privets” where I am proud to stand at No. 2.[^1]

[^1]: 2022-03-10: Alas, no longer.

Maybe its a Thursday thing?

I’m left wondering, of course, what this possibly dyslexic seeker is truly seeking. Infundibulation?

Later ... seems I’m not the only one. the prevert (_sic_) privet seeker was back again today, and in that search, thanks to this post, I’m No. 1.[^1] But someone called Fred [enjoyed similar attention](https://web.archive.org/web/20160820061720/http://www.fragmentsfromfloyd.com/fragments/2004/04/bushes.html) a couple of years ago.
