Somewhat sad to see Marion Nestle, with whom I almost always agree, [linking](https://www.foodpolitics.com/2024/10/pet-food-ii-the-environmental-impact/#:~:text=pet%20food%20sustainability), without question or comment, to an article in a pet-food trade journal which suggests that [insect protein is a key solution to a sustainable pet food industry](https://www.petfoodindustry.com/insect-based-cat-and-dog-food/news/15677692/insect-protein-is-a-key-solution-to-a-sustainable-pet-food-industry). The article contains some eye-opening numbers for the pet food business in the US and globally, as well as some dubious claims about pet health; they are not properly sourced, so I’m not going to bother to address them.

I do, however, take issue with this:

> “In terms of sustainability, the key point is that this isn’t just greenwashing,” said Hobbs. “Insect protein in pet food truly has a significant positive impact.”

It **is** just greenwashing.

Hobbs is Aaron Hobbs, executive director of the North American Coalition for Insect Agriculture (NACIA), so [Mandy Rice-Davies applies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mandy_Rice-Davies_applies). The key point, which neither he nor Marion Nestle seem to have appreciated, but which you will because you listened to the recent episode on [insects as food](https://www.eatthispodcast.com/no-insects/) (for people and their pets), is that the “waste” that insects are reducing is usually a feed product that could be fed direct to livestock and, in some cases, people and their pets.

Premium-priced insect-based pet food might assuage the consciences of some pet owners, but it is unlikely to do anything at all for food waste.
