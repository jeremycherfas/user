The world continues to ignore my ranting. Happy 10th birthday to a piece of pedantry that I will never abandon: [Ceci n'est pas un blog](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/ceci-nest-pas-un-blog).

A more recent bafflement, about the use of web analytics on one's personal site. Jeremy Keith doesn’t use any analytics, and <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://twitter.com/adactio/status/900001910064693249" >says that</a > he regards this as “shouting into a cold, uncaring void”. The pedant in me thinks that it is not so much shouting into the void as sticking your fingers in your ears and singing la la la, I can’t hear you.

That too is lacking, although I know for sure that I was shouting into the void with that ten-year-old rant. Battle lost, _lotta continua sempre_.
