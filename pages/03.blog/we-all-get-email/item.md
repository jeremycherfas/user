You can tell it’s a quiet day in whatever personal blogosphere you explore when people start talking about the comments they’ve had or, better yet, the search terms people used to find them. I should know; I’m guilty. Next in importance, an irrelevance to most readers, is the “I get email” gambit. Which is where I find myself today.

> It is with a great interest that I am sending you this email of notification so as to prevent my proposition being considered as a joke or spam letter. I just decided to contact you for the reason of the fact that I was convinced by the virtue of your names which gave me the impressions to conclude that you must be the right person to contact without any doubts at all, I felt that it was an ideal match with my proposal. I deemed it necessary to share this important matter with you and would like us to do it together in a very cordially manner, so that both of us will benefit from it at the end.

> However, it will indeed be a great honour and pleasure to work with a reliable and trustworthy person like you for both mutual benefiting interests within the shortest time period.

> In addition, I have enclosed herewith a copy of the complete letter detailing my proposition along with this email for you information. If this is ok with you then I wait for your reply.

I didn’t open the attached letter, or dial the number offered later in the email. And there’s really nothing to be gained spending another second trying to figure out what all those words mean. But just in case you recognize your handiwork, and your email of notification is not in fact a joke or spam letter, why don’t you just leave a comment here and I’ll follow up.
