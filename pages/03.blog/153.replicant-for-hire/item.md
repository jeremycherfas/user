Kuala Lumpur is "very Blade Runner". I confess I lean to the Futurama interpetation myself, but a woman who has already visited Chinatown (while I've been oscillating between hotel and conference centre) assured me it was so. In that spirit, my colleague [Ruth](https://mylifeparttwo.wordpress.com/) wishes it to be known that she is available for anyone who would care to stalk a replicant through the rain-soaked streets of KL. She doesn't know what that means, but I do, and that's what counts.
