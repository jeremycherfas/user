> There is rice and there are hungry People. Why do we have to navigate through the "economic minefields" in order to get feed? My family just went to the food bank where they gave us free rice, but no one in our family eats it. I told my son, "Take all that government rice down to the pawn shop and see what they will give you for it." They traded him some videos:Isn't It nice that all "economics" is local.

Not sure I believe this, a comment to an [Economist blog posting](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2008/04/28/have-a-rice-day), but it has been interesting watching various takes on the Food Crisis of 2008.

!!! 2022-04-29: Another case in which the comment has vanished while the article that prompted it remains. Still, I know I copied it exactly from somewhere.
