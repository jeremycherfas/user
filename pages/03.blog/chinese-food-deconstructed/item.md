It takes me a while to catch up with things, sometimes, which is why I have only just watched Jennifer 8 Lee’s stunning talk at Taste3, transmitted through TedTalks. This was magnificent, everything a presentation should be. Packed with information, brilliantly illustrated (I’d like to see all the slides, with just her voice, as the audience must have), and wonderfully entertaining.

[Watch it, at Ted](https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_8_lee_the_hunt_for_general_tso).  

Again, in the realm of catch-up, Lee’s book *The Fortune Cookie Chronicles* is something I'd heard a bit of buzz about, mostly in [Seth Robert’s blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20080509111542/http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/05/05/jane-jacobs-and-chinese-restaurants/) and, as a result, some economics blogs. Roberts links to a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGZ6IwSDyyo) that looks like a longer version of the Ted Talk; it will have to wait. But having now seen one talk, I think I’m going to have to read the book, and Lee’s blog might be worth keeping an eye on too.[^1]

[^1]: 2022-01-27: That's the big dissapointment; it no longer exists. The site remains, but there's absolutely no content. On the other hand, [Jennifer 8. Lee has gone from strength to strength](http://www.jennifer8lee.com/), though no more blogging that I can see.

I haven’t said much about the content; that’s deliberate. But I did like one story. One day in 2005, 110 people shared a single lottery win. Statistically as black a swan as you can imagine. At first, lottery folk thought the fix was in. [But no](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/11/AR2005051101772.html). Almost all the winners had bet on the same numbers, as recommended by a fortune cookie. And fortune cookies aren’t even Chinese originally. Almost no “Chinese” food is. That’s Lee’s point, or at least one of them.

I wonder, has anyone in the UK done as good a job on Indian food?
