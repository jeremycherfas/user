Iâ€™m interupting the delayed-gratification travelblog briefly to announce a fine sighting: a [new collective science blog](http://www.scientificblogging.com/). What I really like is how it came about, which I learned from [Seth Roberts](http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2007/04/16/birth-of-a-website/). Executive summary: Seed Magazine rejected a bunch of applicants who wished to join the pantheon at Science Blogs, but (inadvertently?) let them see one another's emails. So they got together and started a rival. I'm sure each is eying the other nervously -- the score today is 33,900 vs 1,020,000. I think it will be fun to watch them discriminate their niches, and track them against one another.

!!! 2022-04-17: The tragedy, not to make much of it, is that none of those blogging collectives remains today. Which I honestly do think is a bit of a shame.
