I have no idea who either John de Mayo or Josh Stomel are, and frankly I don't care. But I think people ought to know about plagiarists. That [Josh Stomel ripped off John de Mayo](https://web.archive.org/web/20060806223253/http://www.johndemayo.com/johndemayocom/2006/01/josh_stomel_rip.html) (and many others) thus becomes worth linking to.
