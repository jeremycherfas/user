Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.?  This week: ??.?  
**Friday 15 December:** Is this how it ends, two weeks in a row without a weigh-in and a complete lack of regularity? No, indeed not. But all the signs are there, of much work, much travel, and the impending holiday season. I haven’t had early-morning access to my scales for more than two days in a row since late November, so no point in posting fictive figures. The few weighings I have managed indicate that all is mostly well.

In other news -- and why not combine other food news? -- a strange twist to the [follow up on no-knead bread](http://jeremycherfas.net/blog/bread-details/) in the New York Times. (And as the original link has vanished behind a paywall, here's a [fresh one that works](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/06mini.html?ex=1323061200&en=9e22512bbaa1a423&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss).) Impressed by the suggestion that “a [Silpat mat](https://web.archive.org/web/20031223170726/http://homecooking.about.com/cs/productreviews/gr/silpat.htm) under the dough is a clever idea” I dropped more than $25 for one of the buggers. Completely bloody useless. If that’s non-sticky, I’m a Grecian urn. The dough stuck good and proper, so much so that I had real work to do to get it off the mat and into the hot casserole, with resultant disruption of my gluten network and much less of a spring in the loaf. Still delicious though. You have been warned.
