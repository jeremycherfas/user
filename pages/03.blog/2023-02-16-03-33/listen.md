Episode summary: On October 4, 1960, Eastern Airlines Flight 375 took off from Boston&rsquo;s Logan airport, and then, two minutes later, it crashed. 62 people died. Investigators couldn&rsquo;t figure out what had happened, and they decided to ask a scientist working at the Smithsonian for help. Roxie Laybourne&rsquo;s investigation helped launch a whole new field of science that changed aviation and forensics.
