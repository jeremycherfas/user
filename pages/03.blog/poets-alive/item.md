_This post is number 41 in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

Blue Girl breaks new ground by [embedding a video](https://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2008/04/daydreaming-50.html?cid=111467274#comment-111467274) in a 50 x 100 x 50 post. Just don’t watch it, unless you like being manipulated into an eye-blinking, lump-throated slump. I like to think that my own paltry genre-extension -- doubling up on words after I’d missed a post -- was as worthy, but it isn’t. I confess, I did toy with the idea of 100 little snapshots of the event instead, but that would of course have been 10,000 words, and that would never do. I never was taught about poetry properly, alas.
