[![Luminescent jellyfish](378241096_e1da42c49f_m.jpg){.left}](http://flickr.com/photos/psychoscheiko/378241096/) The best, and worst, skinny dip I can recall was the time I was filming in Vienna, where my mother happened to live, and the assistant producer and I went for a walk with my Mum by the banks of the Danube, or the Danube canal. It was quite a warm day, and Ma suddenly announced that she was going in. So in we went. I was a little bit mortified, but also quite proud of us. The assistant producer was pretty game too.

Swimming naked is glorious, and even better when thereâ€™s time to dry off properly in the sun.
