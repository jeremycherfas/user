Long ago -- and I really can't say when or where -- I remember reading about a bank that had supposedly written the following letter to a woman (I remember it was a woman; I could easily be wrong) who had been running a large and unauthorized overdraft:

> Dear Madam,
> 
> Could we please return to our former arrangement, whereby you banked money with us?
> Yours etc.

I am reminded of this today by a letter quoted by [Andrew Tobias](https://andrewtobias.com/insufficient-funds/), this time from a customer to his bank:

> Dear Sirs:
> 
> One of my checks was returned marked "insufficient funds." Does that refer to me or you?

Neat-o.
