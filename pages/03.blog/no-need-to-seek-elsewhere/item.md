After whinging a bit about not being able to keep up here, and contemplating some other platform, I did a bit of looking around and was reminded of this WordPress feature, which I seldom used before: [Press It « WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Press_It). It does make a quick posting pretty easy. Maybe all I need to do to maintain the flow is to use it more often. This being by way of a test.
