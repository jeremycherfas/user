Daniel Mosquin is a working scientist. He maintains a wonderful blog [Botany Photo of the Day](https://botanyphoto.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca/). The blog contains science. It ranks at 35 on the Technorati scheme that Nature used to puff the [top 50 science blogs](https://web.archive.org/web/20060711100323/https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/50_science_blogs.html). But it isn't in that list. I confess. I didn't notice. And Daniel is very magnanimous about being left off the list: "Ah well," he [writes](https://botanyphoto.botanicalgarden.ubc.ca/2006/07/lilium_columbianum/), "I still recommend visiting the science weblogs on the list -- many gems in there."
