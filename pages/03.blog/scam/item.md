I just don't get it. This email arrives:

> Thanks...

It has been sent to me (at a very old address) and nine select brethren. But whatâ€™s in it for Craig, or Anthony, or whoever? Is this just an attempt to see whether there is a live person at the other end of the line, one who not only has a store online but is also stupid enough to respond to this sort of thing? If so, why? What sort of scam is this anyway?

p.s. I don't have a store, online or anywhere else.
