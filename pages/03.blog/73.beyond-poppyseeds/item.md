Poppyseeds can be a nightmare for anyone subject to random drug tests. This much I knew, having researched the topic for [my poppyseed cake recipe](http://www.fornacalia.com/2013/poppyseed-cake/). I never imagined, though, that food could be more than just a little soporific. ABC Radio in Australia hauled Fuschia Dunlop before a microphone to enliven a discussion about the latest news about Chinese cooking. She reminisced:

===

> As the afternoon went on we just got more and more relaxed until everyone just felt drowsy. We all went and fell asleep on beds and sofas and I can still remember having this absolutely blissful sleep. When I woke up I went back into the kitchen and I noticed that there were poppy heads bobbing around in the broth.

[ABC's story](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/gastronomic-addiction-in-china/5999824) contains the usual warnings about innocent people failing drug tests, but I found it more interesting for a couple of other points. 

First, although banned in 2008, it is still possible to get opiated grub at small, family run restaurants, "thanks to a lack of health and safety oversight".

Then there's the question you know they just had to ask:

>What does it taste like?

>‘Under the assault of Szechuan pepper and chillies and black beans and all the other ingredients you wouldn't notice it,’ says Dunlop.

>‘It's just another spice, but with a rather interesting effect.’

Uh-huh.

And finally, I wouldn't be true to myself if I failed to point out that the photo accompanying the audio file, while definitely **a** poppy is definitely not an **opium** poppy.
