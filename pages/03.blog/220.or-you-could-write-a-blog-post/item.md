Here's something I didn't know I needed: Jared Sinclair's new app [Stormcrow](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/158917878165/stormcrow)

===

> Type all your tweets into a single text view. Stormcrow will automatically separate your paragraphs into a thread of automatically-numbered tweets. Publish them all at once at the tap of a button. Spend less time futzing with reply buttons and counting tweets, and focus on what youâ€™re trying to say.

I have the greatest respect for Jared's app Riposte, which is the bee's knees for interacting with pnut and ADN before it, and I'm sure he is meeting a need for many people. But sheesh, if you want to write a blog post, write a blog post, not a flock of tweets, no matter how orderly.
