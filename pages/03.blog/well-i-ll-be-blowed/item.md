That old joke about oral sex and lobster thermidor? Simply not funny any more. [Tim Harford explains](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029065901/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c8a5e558-3339-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html) why giving head is now the _dish de jour_ among certain groups of teenage girls. It seems to have little to do with the reasons advanced by a slightly overwrought Caitlin Flanagan in [The Atlantic Monthly](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/01/are-you-there-god-its-me-monica/304511/). Flanagan overwrote:


> The moms in my set are convinced -- they're certain; they know for a *fact* -- that all over the city, in the very best schools, in the nicest families, in the leafiest neighborhoods, twelve- and thirteen-year-old girls are performing oral sex on as many boys as they can. They're ducking into janitors' closets between classes to do it; they're doing it on school buses, and in bathrooms, libraries, and stairwells. They're making bar mitzvah presents of the act, and performing it at "train parties": boys lined up on one side of the room, girls working their way down the row.

But while she touched on a whole bunch of reasons that she thought behind the trend, Flanagan missed the one reason isolated by the economists whose work Harford reports: It's safer. (She also missed the fact that it might also be as much fun to give as to receive, but that's a whole 'nother [godbotherin' story](http://christdot.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8401).)

[^1]: *16 February 2020*: Wouldn't you know it; while I was able, with some effort, to track down links that worked for the two substantive pieces I wrote about, this final one is nowhere to be found. And I cannot dredge up what it might have said.
