> “Under the armpit and knee of River Plate you can see that the marble is still smooth as it once was. But the amazing and enormous head is rough and lined like an old man.”

I just love the idea of the River Plate’s armpit. The real thing’s not bad either. The [restoration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1538731/Berninis-fountain-to-be-rescued-from-acid-rain.html) of Bernini’s fountain at the centre of the Piazza Navona should be fun to watch. Especially after it is done, when small electric shock pads will, authorities hope, keep pigeons away.
