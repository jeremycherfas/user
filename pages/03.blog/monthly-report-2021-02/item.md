Still healthy, which is nice. The winter has been unseasonably mild and spring — surely a false spring — is upon us, with teeny leaves and flower buds and a promise of good things to come.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- Day One is good, and I really appreciate the *on this day* element. Far better than my memory.
- Pushed up a notch on the HIIT, and settling into it.
- Got yet another identity card that says I am entitled to be here.
- But no sign of my driving licence, since October 2019.
- Bought an item of clothing, the first since December 2019 (aside from undies).
- Read Single & Single by John Le Carré.

### Activities

Closed all rings every day. 

Deeply jealous of @cleverdevil’s [Taking Control of my Personal Health Data](https://cleverdevil.io/2021/taking-control-of-my-personal-health-data), but it could be a great opportunity to do something with the Python course I am still working on. Now that we have got to tuples and lists and objects are fast approaching, it is becoming more useful.

#### February: 
* Walking with sticks: 0
* Reading: 14
* Steps (avge): 11,137 
* Podcasts: 45 (38 of them [logged](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/stream/))
* In bed/asleep 8:25/7:38 Getting lighter?
* 7 Minutes: 11 days; alternating 2 cycles moderate and 3 cycles cardio blast.
* Weight (avge): 86.2 

#### January: 
* Walking with sticks: 0
* Reading: 15
* Steps (avge): 10,417 
* Podcasts: 40 (33 of them [logged](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/stream/))
* In bed/asleep 8:30/7:46
* 7 Minutes: 13 days; alternating 2 cycles moderate and 3 cycles easy.
* Weight (avge): 86.3 

### Work

After the ghastliness of January, February was a return to sanity, with all frogs swallowed on schedule.

#### Hours logged per month

### Goals

Four new posts, and four old ones which, as ever, I am hawking here:

* [Blue Girl demands tribute](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/blue-girl-demands-tribute/)
* [A slightly closer look at bio-energy: part 1](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/a-slightly-closer-look-at-bioenergy-part-1/)
* [How to admit to, and correct, a mistake](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/how-to-admit-to-and-correct-a-mistake/)
* [Lab assistant style](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/lab-assistant-style/)

### Niggles

The Python course I am taking is really thorough, and I am learning tons. The niggle is that it is very mathematical, at least in the early stages, and I want to be getting on with things. Still, plugging away is good.

### Final remarks

Not sure I really want to think about the future in any detail. It would be nice to be free to travel, but the travel itself no longer appeals. Maybe I’ll get over it.
