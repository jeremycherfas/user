## Stormy weather

Don't know why, there's no sun up in the sky ... has been the lament for far too many weeks, and not only here in Rome. So [here for your delectation](18-Stormy-Weather.mp3) is Ivie Anderson fronting the Duke Ellington Orchestra in a 1933? recording of Stormy Weather. There's also a [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeuafK31EUw) of a different recording.
