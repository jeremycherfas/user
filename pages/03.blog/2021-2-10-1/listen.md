Episode summary: Rick Rubin speaks with the great Joan Baez fresh off her birthday and the announcement that she’ll be among this year’s Kennedy Center honorees! Joan was known the world over as the Queen of Folk at the height of her career in the 60s. She used her fame to help spread the tenets of the non-violence movement, and was a close ally to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Joan also helped introduce Bob Dylan to the world by giving him stage time at her shows when she was the biggest ticket in town and he was a complete unknown. In this conversation with Rick Rubin, Joan explains why after performing for over 60 years, she recently made the decision to stop singing and turn her attention to painting. She also talks about the time she and Pete Seeger were run out of town by local cops after a performance and getting banned from Brazil for her music.
