Quite by coincidence, given yesterday’s [post about weighing](http://jeremycherfas.net/blog/food-news-15/), the Washington Post has an article about a programme to help people keep weight off by reaping the [benefits of daily weighings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/16/AR2006101600942.html). Brown University scientists recruited people who had lost 10 per cent of their body weight over the past two years, and gave them a set of scales and instructions to use them, often. Guinea pigs also phoned in weekly results. Those who stayed in the “green” zone, within 3 pounds of their current weight, received little treats, like mint gum and even dollar bills. Those who strayed into the “yellow” zone, 3 to 5 pounds overweight, triggered warnings to “tweak” their exercise and eating. More than 5 pounds triggered a “red” alarm: 

> They were told to start dieting again and were urged to open an emergency toolbox that included a pedometer, a diary to record their food intake and a meal-replacement shake. For inspiration, they received a copy of their own weight-loss success story that they had written for researchers as the study began. They also were offered one-on-one weight-loss counseling to get back on track.

Apparently the whole scheme worked rather well, which is not all that surprising, considering that we are social animals who respond pretty well to praise and incentives.

One strange comment in the article though, is that “successful losers ... rarely miss breakfast”. Breakfast seem to have some sort of iconic status, the start to the day, breaking the fast and all that. I used to think the same myself. But since I have been on the Shangri-La diet I have come to realize that a day without breakfast is just as fine as one with. And for many people, skipping breakfast improves sleep. There was that big LA Times article on [The Breakfast Hype](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-18-he-breakfast18-story.html) that didn’t really come down one way or the other, so I think the jury is still out. I also think that one should do what feels best, and not be constrained by common wisdom about the importance of a good start to the day.

Thanks Gail for the article.
