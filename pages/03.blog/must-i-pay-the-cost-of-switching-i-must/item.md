About this time last year, and the year before that and the year before that, a thought troubled me. Could this be the year I kiss Quicken goodbye?

Anyone who has used this venerable financial package -- especially on a Mac -- will surely sympathise. I'm not going to go into the myriad ways in which Quicken truly blows chunks -- especially on a Mac. Lets just say that the experience is not one to be savoured -- especially on a Mac. So as the end of the financial year drifts around I cast my eye about in search of a viable alternative, and the remarkable thing is that despite what must surely be a large market out there -- people even say that Quicken is the one thing that [stops people switching](http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20100224/mac-quicken-gets-deductions-for-iffy-upgrade/) to a Mac -- nothing leaps out as **the** one to try.

This year was no different, except in one regard. Quicken had a new version out supposedly engineered from the ground up for the Mac. For a moment I hoped all would be well. But, perhaps fortunately, this new version continues the tradition set by its ancestors. It too blows chunks, and Mossberg [isn't the only person who thinks so](http://mashable.com/2010/02/25/quicken-essentials-mac/#comment-36887705). So I cast my eye about again and lit on five contenders: [iBank](http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/features.php#ibank3_nav), [Moneydance](http://moneydance.com/features), [iFinance](http://www.synium.de/products/ifinance/index.html#FAQ), [My Money](http://www.mthbuilt.com/products.html) and [Money](http://www.jumsoft.com/money/). All say they will import old Quicken data, and all have a free trial. So I'm going to do a bit of paper and pencil work, because if someone else has I can't find it, and then try them in descending order of suitability. We shall see.

Unless, of course, there really is one that stands head and shoulders above the others, in which case, please let me know, and soon.

*p.s. 21 September 2017: I ended up with iBank, now Banktivity, and it is OK. But that's all it is.*
