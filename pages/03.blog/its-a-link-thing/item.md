This is too good to be true. Yesterday I read <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://seblog.nl/2018/10/22/13/three-things-about-readers" >Sebastiaan's write-up</a > of how he graphically a link between two individuals who both liked the same thing on the internet, and how, by doing that, he could alert himself to things he might like.

Today I finally see, in my reader, an earlier post from Kicks Condor, in which he talks about <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://www.kickscondor.com/emergent-connections-between-you-the-readers-of-these-hypertext-piles/" >surfacing other readers who have linked to things he has linked</a >, and how that might help him to discover interesting things to read. That could even be the basis of a self-organising discovery engine.

Clearly, they ought to know about one another. Maybe this post of mine will trigger that.
