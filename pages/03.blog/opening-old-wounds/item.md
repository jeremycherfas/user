After a frustrating afternoon pursuing deep geekiness (with some progress, and which I may write more about) I decided to cheer myself up by continuing the endless, thankless and probably pointless task of bringing old posts over here. Three of the five aroused intense memories.

* There was the day [my sweet dog was attacked](https:jeremycherfas.net/blog/thank-you-dr-lanza) by another bitch, and the utterly irresponsible and pathetic response of her owner. Plus the heroism of the vet, and Mellie's later demise.
* There was an early piece [in praise of podcasts](https:jeremycherfas.net/blog/what-i-like-about-podcasts).
* And there was [the first time I met Rachel Roddy](https:jeremycherfas.net/blog/mentuccia-is-not-pennyroyal), who was on the brink of great things and was instrumental in helping my own podcast go on to great things too.

All in all, a nice little session.
