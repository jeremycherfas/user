Below please find the two lead paras of a [Guardian story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/31/colombia.religion) filed last week. Thanks to ~~[Frinktank](http://www.frinktank.com/)~~. I have no comment whatsoever.

> A Vatican official has said the Catholic church will excommunicate a medical team who performed Colombia's first legal abortion on an 11-year-old girl, who was eight weeks pregnant after being raped by her stepfather.  
> Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, the president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family, said in addition to the doctors and nurses, the measure could apply to "relatives, politicians and lawmakers" whom he called "protagonists in this abominable crime".

Like I care what those dickheads think of evolution.
