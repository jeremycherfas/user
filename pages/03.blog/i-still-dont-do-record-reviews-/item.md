... but if you're looking for some cutting-edge, ground-breaking, genre-bending, challenging music, keep away from these two:

![Album artwork](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007QJ1FC.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg){.left} Los Super Seven’s _[Heard it on the X](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B0007QJ1FC/141-5565242-0720353?SubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002/141-5565242-0720353)_ is just rollicking good border music. Too short, which indicates how used I’ve become to bloated CDs. Time was I would have been more than happy with a 37-minute LP.

![Album artwork](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0007VROHE.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg){.left}  John Prine's _[Fair and Square](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/B0007VROHE/141-5565242-0720353?SubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002/141-5565242-0720353)_ is fine folkish stuff but with his usual witty lyrics and some wonderful squeezebox and harmony.

I realise neither counts as an off the wall recommendation, but some of the time I need to be very definitely on the wall. Fact is, last week’s shipment, which brought these and [_Chávez Ravine_](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/i-dont-do-record-reviews-), is perhaps the most successful threesome I’ve ever had the pleasure of purchasing.
