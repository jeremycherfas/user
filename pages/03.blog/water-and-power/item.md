![An overshot watermill wheel in Polperrow, Cornwall. The top half of the wheel with wooden buckets against the white stone walls of the mill. Above is the wooden sluice that feeds water into the buckets to turn the wheel, although no water is flowing. Some of the buckets have green plants growing in them.](odb-16-image.jpg){.center}
