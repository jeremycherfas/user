Last week I was sorting through my recipe folder — the physical one, which is a mess of printed, scribbled and ripped bits of paper — and came across a bread that I had not made before and that for some reason called to me.

It was very good, so I wrote it up at the other place: [flaxseed currant ciabatta](https://www.fornacalia.com/2020/flaxseed-currant-ciabatta/).

I should note, too, that it made an excellent basis for a canonical hipster lunch.
