Caused by a break. To my wrist. My right one, my writing one. It has been patched up and is supposed to be on the mend, but it may be some time before I can write at length. I can type, but it is not easy and is pretty tiring. And there is so much I wanted to say. You might almost say I have been brooding. I suppose it will keep.
