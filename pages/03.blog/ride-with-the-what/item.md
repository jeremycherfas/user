I didn’t know [Ang Lee](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000487/) had directed oaters before he got to Brokeback Mountain, and having now seen [Ride with the Devil](http://imdb.com/title/tt0134154/), I’m not surprised. Uncannily, there was another film of the exact same title released in 1999. And equally uncannily, Lee’s film recalls every other civil war Southern Gennlemen honouring th’ ladies, treating th’ nigras fair, speakin’ real purty, tossing their luxuriant locks and lamenting th’ churlish Federals. It’s OK, but there didn’t seem to be anything all that devilish about it. Not Josey Wales, that’s fer sher.

My rating: 3 out of 5
