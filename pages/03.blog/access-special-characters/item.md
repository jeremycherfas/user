One of the reasons I subscribe to [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) is that every so often I learn something incredibly useful that I had no idea existed. So it was today. <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/frank.rausch/" >Frank Rausch</a > casually mentioned an Alfred workflow (which he wrote) to access special characters. Less than a minute later, all my troubles seemed so far away. I can £ and ⌘ and make my ⎋ as never before.

Thanks Frank.
