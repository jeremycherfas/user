Twitter passed me by at the start, and if I am honest I still don't really get it. Today, though, I was bringing in old posts as usual, and they included links to a couple that were, to put it delicately, [skeptical about Twitter's chances](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/01/17/Where-to-Write). Tim Bray got one thing very right:

He was hoping for federated blogging, and pointed to Laconica, which seems to have been an instance of identi.ca. Both still exist, but as far as I can tell have not fulfilled their promise; ready to be corrected on that.

And all that took me, in a roundabout way, to this:
