”It’s terrible. It’s not even good.”

“Well you can just go fuck yourself.”  
“I love that woman, I just can’t help it.”

“I’m deleting this. You’re OK with that?”

“You don’t need more wine. You need a sausage.”

“Dude, what did you just throw at me?”

“You’re just going to drink this water. That’s what you’re going to do. Just drink this water.”

“Guys? Can we make a motion to stay here and not go to the ... Do we have to go to the museum?”

“It’s hard to see it unravel, to see a place that you love just not work.”

“Max. I love you Max.”  
“I love you more Max.”

“Oh no. I’m drunk.”

“Lucy’s not here. Julia’s not here too.”

“Everybody get their own seat.”

“It’s not a fun thing. Like you should be ashamed.”

“I’m so embarrassed for this group of people.”

“Everybody’s puking.”

“Is Rob puking?”

“Actually, he’s not fine.”

“Cameron. D’you want a bag?”
