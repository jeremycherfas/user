World this day, international that week, global the other month. 

Normally I find out about these things too late to do anything about it. So I'm actually grateful to Eattiamo -- who'll send a box of Italian goodies to your doorstep, if you're in the USA -- for pointing out that 25 October happens to be both World Pasta Day and two months and a day since the earthquake that brought the town of Amatrice down. What better way to kill two birds with one stone [^1] than to eat pasta all'Amatriciana that day and donate a little more to restoring the town?

While the [initial response was huge](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/25/491370926/food-world-rallies-for-quake-hit-amatrice-home-of-famous-pasta-dish), Eattiamo reminds us that memories fade fast, and so wants people to do it all over again.

Obviously Eattiamo would like you to [order your meal from them](https://us.eattiamo.com/world-pasta-day-pasta-allamatriciana-amatrice) but if you don't fancy that they've got plenty of other ideas of how to celebrate.

The [big shindig](http://www.worldpastaday2016.org) this year is in Moscow. I'll be ignoring that for sure, but I will be eating for Amatrice.
