I’ve read scads about [pecha kucha](https://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/06/felix-jungs-pecha-kucha-presentation-tips.html) and how the discipline of presenting ideas within the constraint of 20 slides at 20 seconds each can [unleash a torrent of creativity](https://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/09/pecha-kucha-and.html). Now I’ve got a chance to see for myself. The University of Washington’s Design in Rome programme is giving it a go this evening, and I am really looking forward to it. There was a [Pecha Kucha Night™ here](https://www.pechakucha.com/cities/rome) and judging by the web site, I’m not sorry to have missed it. I hope my hopes aren’t too high.

! 2021-09-17: There has not been a Rome night since 2014.
