Went for a walk in the park this morning tooled up with a trowel. I’d seen some likely looking bay laurel seedlings on previous recce trips, and with last night’s rain thought that the ground would be reasonably soft. It was. Snagged five little seedlings then headed down the hill to the nearest nursery. There I found four white _Lilium regale_ bulbs, a dahlia (Bishop of Llandaff, of course) and a nice square pot. Back up the hill I planted the lilies in the new pot, put the dahlia and bays into old pots and washed my hands.

That’s what passes for gardening around here. Something like it is going to happen most weekends from now on, I suspect.
