A kindly reader (I'm still foolishly pleased to discover that I have any) points out that my RSS feed does not validate. At this point I have to confess that I hadn’t given Tinderbox’s handling of RSS any thought at all. I assumed it works. And it certainly seems to. But just in case I went looking and found a [suggestion](https://web.archive.org/web/20060704223012/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02/important_change_to_the_link_tag) that I should maybe have declared my RSS stuff in the head of my HTML. I’m still not sure what exactly this means. But I have put something like this into all the code and now I just have to hope that this will do the trick. No chance to find out till I’ve updated though. If it does, I’ll have to inform the TB crew. If not, I’ll have to ask ditto.

On which topic, I have been neglecting this blog of late. I have my reasons, of course.

  * Working on something else for work, burning the midnight oil, not wanting to bore everyone with my meanderings through misunderstood CSS and PHP.

  * Dentistry. Nobody could possibly want to hear about the root canal that has been making my life a misery. This isn’t That Kind of Blog.

  * General lackadaisicality.

  * Weirdly, TB seems to have lost my registration on the latest version. My registration has run out! How time flies when you're having fun.


Later ... my original approach to fixing the RSS feed problem did not work. So I’ve admitted failure and asked for advice.
