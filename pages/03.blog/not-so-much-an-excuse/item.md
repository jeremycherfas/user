... as an explanation. This blog has been getting an awful lot of neglect really. It [isn’t the first time](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/if-this-blog/), and it is often at around this time of year. And the same excuses that applied back then still apply, somewhat.

Somewhere, irrationally, I really do believe that I have only a certain number of words inside me each day. The limited time is less germane. But if I’ve used the words up, doing IMs or crafting deathless prose and dumb emails at work, there don’t seem to be any left for here. The real culprit, however, has probably been [The Other Blog](https://agro.biodiver.se/). That has taken a heap of hand-holding lately, over weekends when I should have been grooming here.

But relationships require work, so I’m resolved to put a little more effort in here. Soon. Honest.
