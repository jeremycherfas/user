The Kellogg Company just [announced ](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2009/04/27/Kellogg-s-donates-one-day-s-cereal-production-to-food-banks)that it will donate one full day’s cereal production to something called the [Feeding America](https://feedingamerica.org/) food bank network. Good for them. What staggered me was not the fact of Kellogg’s generosity but the size of it. A day’s cereal production is 3.5 million pounds, or 1,587,573.3 kg in real money. That seems like an awful lot of cereal. But it is just 5 grams per person for the 306 million people in the US.

Someone isn’t eating their cornflakes.
