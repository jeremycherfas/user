[![Hitch-hiker holding a sign that reads East](223049436-4a9af7f619-m.jpg){.left}](http://flickr.com/photos/macwagen/223049436/) Like yesterday’s pillow fight, my response is, “yes, who hasn’t?”. On second thoughts I don’t know how many people do hitch hike these days. Way too dangerous, everyone seems to think. And I cannot remember the last time I actually saw someone hitching.

But we used to do it all the time, occasionally perhaps foolishly so.

Nowadays you can use your [thumb on a mouse](https://web.archive.org/web/20211005095932/http://www.roadsharing.com/) instead of on the open road, which takes all the fun out of it, but also guarantees that you won’t stop for some babe and have her three “brothers” emerge from behind a nearby tree.
