Episode summary: This week&rsquo;s Great Political Fiction is Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s monumental play Mary Stuart (1800), which lays bare the impossible choices faced by two queens &ndash; Elizabeth I of England and Mary Queen of Scots &ndash; in a world of men. Schiller imagines a meeting between them that never took place and unpicks its fearsome consequences. Why does it do such damage to them both? How does the powerless Mary maintain her hold over the imperious Elizabeth? Who suffers most in the end and what is that suffering really worth?Next week: Turgenev&rsquo;s Fathers and Sons (1862)Coming up: The Ideas Behind American Elections &ndash; a twice-weekly series running throughout March with Gary Gerstle, looking at 8 American presidential elections from 1800 to 2008 and exploring the ideas that shaped them and helped to shape the world.Coming soon: sign up to the PPFIdeas newsletter!
