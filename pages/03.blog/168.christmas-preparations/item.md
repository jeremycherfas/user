We'll be eating a goose tonight with friends, and preparations are well under way. In order to be absolutely ready, though, we needed to be sure that there would be rye bread in the house, for the inevitable leftover goose sandwiches. And that sent me searching for the recipe for Dan Lepard's Black Pepper Rye, one of the best savoury sandwich breads I know.

===

I couldn't find it in my bulging file of bits of paper, so I turned to Google, and discovered that my own blog post on the subject was number 2 in the results. But it was not actually available, because I am still in the process of transferring stuff into this CMS.

So, while I waited for the dough to rise between kneads, I did the needful. The relevant posts are:  
* [Dan Lepard's Black Pepper Rye](../dan-lepard-s-black-pepper-rye)
* [Mr DIY](../mr-diy)

You just about have time.
