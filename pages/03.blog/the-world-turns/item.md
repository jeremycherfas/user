I cannot be absolutely certain, but it is just possible that I have never before published a blog post on 23<sup>rd</sup> October. At least, today is the first day since I started regularly bringing in old posts that I have found nothing to do. Of course, I may have brought one in before, but I cannot search on that basis.[^1]

As it is far too meta to write a post only about not having written a post on this day, I better add something faintly ridiculous. Today is a sad day indeed, because the bathroom mirror was all fogged up after my shower. That means winter is here. The heat in this apartment is so ineffectual that putting it on will not make any difference, and each year at this time I contemplate growing a beard until the mirror no longer fogs up, sometime in March or April, but I never do.

[^1]: I had, although it did not amount to anything.
