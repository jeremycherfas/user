Updated one of the more useful Grav plugins, TwigFeeds. This had been rewritten to take advantage of a better feed-reading service, and so I needed to change one or two things to make it work properly. The excellent instructions made that extremely easy, which is nice.

===

I briefly thought about using the Twigfeeds plugin to add a link to the latest Eat This Podcast over there in the sidebar, but for now I have decided against it. That's one for later.

Maybe later today I'll have a little time to play seriously with `chartist.js`. If that works, I may update here. Or I may save it for tomorrow.
