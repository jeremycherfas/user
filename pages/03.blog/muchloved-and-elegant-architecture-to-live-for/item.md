In modern architecture as in everything, there is good and there is bad. So I wonder what that [monstrous carbuncle](https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speech/speech-hrh-prince-wales-150th-anniversary-royal-institute-british-architects-riba-royal-gala) on the face of the much-loved British monarchy would make of this entertaining and very funny [Ted Talk by Bjarke Ingels](https://www.ted.com/talks/bjarke_ingels_3_warp_speed_architecture_tales)?

The buildings, like the architect, struck me as thoughtful, amusing, ecologically sensitive, highly desirable and entirely likable. Not at all the sort of thing one would expect from “[brogue-footed lickspits in search of, if not knighthoods and peerages, then a biscuit-tin architecture that was somehow meant to recall the glories of Georgian design](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/may/17/architecture.regeneration)”. I’d love one to [pockmark my skyline](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/01/design.architecture).
