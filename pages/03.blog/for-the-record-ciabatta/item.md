Decided to get out of my baking bread comfort zone a couple of weeks ago to make some ciabatta. It was difficult work, but ultimately worthwhile, and in pursuit of my goal to maintain a record of my other online activities here, I'm linking to [sourdough ciabatta](http://www.fornacalia.com/2013/sourdough-ciabatta/).

This also raises the question of what to do about plurals of foreign words. It drives me a teeny bit nuts when movie characters, and ordinary people, ask for "a biscotti" or "a panini". So should I maintain my pedantic persona and refer to *ciabatte* when I'm talking about several ciabattas?
