As we head off for a couple of weeks away from home, catsitting for a dear friend, I thought I would get a jump on my usual tardiness and try to get my laptop in order and fully functional. As this would also be the first time using this laptop to do a bit of coding — at least that’s the plan — I also had to install all that stuff. Luckily, I had made a note of [Chris Amico’s guide](https://chrisamico.com/blog/2023-01-14/python-setup/) which, along with the bits I have learned about environments, made the whole thing a lot less stressful than it might have been.

I still don’t know enough about how to do these things on a networked machine. If I did, perhaps none of this shuffling would be necessary. Learning that, however, is not on my agenda. Trying to understand Keyboard Maestro a bit better is on my agenda, so I moved all that over too and synched my few existing macros. The other thing I need to try and sort out is how to mirror my `zsh` setup. I’m hoping that will not be too difficult. Maybe tomorrow morning. Oh, and Karabiner, or similar.
