I'm late to the news that [Michael Reiss has resigned](https://royalsociety.org/news/2012/professor-michael-reiss/) [^fn1] as Director of Education at the Royal Society. PZ has compiled the important bits (The RoySoc's announcement and Richard Dawkins'' response) over at [Pharyngula](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/royal_society_statement_regard.php). The best bit is the way [Dawkins handles the whole issue of accommodationism](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14748-letter-richard-dawkins-on-the-royal-society-row/) (would appeasement be an easier word?). Dawkins concludes:

> Perhaps, rather than resign his job with the Royal Society, Professor Reiss might consider resigning his Orders?

And PZ adds:

> Let us ask, though, if these brave paladins of Jesus-compatible science would be willing to set aside their religion to better endorse science â€” and I think we all know what the answer would be.

Amen to that, bros.
