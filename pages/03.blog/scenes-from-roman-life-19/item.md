![Sign on wall](img-5245.jpg){.center} 

The sign says: _It is three weeks that this glass is here on the ground. I don't know who has the job of removing it ... If you leave a broom near here, I will clean it, if whoever ought to do it doesn't come._ That may be a smiley too. It went up on Wednesday, but I didn't have my camera. I snapped it on Thursday, but I didn't have the time. It is still there today, and so is the glass.

Here's the part I don't understand. Someone had a big piece of paper, a thick black marker, and a roll of fat blue tape, but they didn't have a broom? If the authorities haven't swept it yet, and they come by, are they going to leave the broom, rather than grab the glass? It's really art, but I don't understand it? I mean, WTF?
