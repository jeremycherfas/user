Perhaps I am borderline obsessive,[^1] but I’m always struck when I send an email to somebody, don’t get a reply within, say, a week, send a follow up and then get ”Sorry about that! Went to my spam.” My spam filter is simply glorious, but that doesn’t mean it catches everything, nor that everything that it catches is spam. So, every couple of days I run my eye down the Subject lines and rescue the occasional piece of _prosciutto_.

Doesn’t everyone?
