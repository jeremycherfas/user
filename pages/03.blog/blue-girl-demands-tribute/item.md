_What did the duck say to the cashier when he was buying Chapstick?_

_Put it on my bill._

I'm not too sure how this works. Some kind of infection. But Blue Girl requires me to [acknowledge her comedic genius](http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/2007/10/ba-dum-bum.html) (which I am happy to do, especially if the joke is original; she doesn't say.)

Then I have to email this post to [M.A. Peel](http://mapeel.blogspot.com/) (which I will do when it has been posted).

Then, I think, I can optionally add to the sum total of global hilarity by adding a joke of my own. Which I will also do. Except that it isn't my own.

_A guy from the city is taking a Sunday drive in the country. As he passes an orchard, he sees a farmer standing under an apple tree near the road, holding up a small pig who is eating apples off the tree. Amazed, he pulls over, gets out, and asks the farmer what in the world he's doing._

_The farmer says "Well, Petunia here can't reach the apples by herself, so I'm giving her a little help."_

_The city slicker can't believe what he's hearing. "Isn't that an amazing waste of time?"_

_The farmer responds, puzzled: "What's time to a pig?"_

I got that from [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/). And I used it first at [Agro.biodiver.se](http://agro.biodiver.se/).

Now what? Am I better yet?
