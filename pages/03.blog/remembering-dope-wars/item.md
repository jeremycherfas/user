For the first time, since starting to do the on-this-day thing, I came across a blog post that I had written in 2004 and that was not in my local archive. Very luckily, the Wayback Machine had saved it, so I was able to repatriate it.

What I found really mindboggling is that the geeky details in the post — [Nibs, nerds & notes](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/nibs-nerds-notes) — would probably be utterly meaningless to anyone born after about 2000. The central core, though, of on-the-go information storage and retrieval, remains relevant today, as does the need to be entertained during train delays and dull meetings. 

The iPhone does all that pretty well and — I just checked — it even has several lame versions of something like Dope Wars. I no longer need one of them.
