Almost two years ago a woman was arrested in Melbourne when customs officers heard [suspicious “flipping” noises](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna8117876) emanating from beneath her skirts. I remember it, because [I blogged it](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/surprise/). At last, the case has come to trial, but the report that alerted me did not give details of the sentence. She’s doing [nine months](https://www.theage.com.au/national/customs-nets-fine-catch-as-skirt-reveals-51-fish-20070303-ge4cbw.html).
