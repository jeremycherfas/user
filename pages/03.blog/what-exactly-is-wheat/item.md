A single cell of modern bread wheat contains more than five times the DNA of a human cell, in a much more complicated arrangement. As a result, it has taken a fair old while to decode wheatâ€™s genome. Having done so, though, the DNA confirms what plant scientists have long suspected; bread wheat is the result of two separate occasions on which an ancestor of wheat crossed with a goat grass. The DNA also tells us when those crosses might have happened.
