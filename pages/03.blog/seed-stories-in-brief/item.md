Just caught up with the podcast version of Dan Saladino's excellent [Seed Stories from the Lockdown](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000k1c8) on Radio 4's The Food Programme, and of course it prompted a flood of emotions, reminiscences and recognitions.

There are two kinds of tomato, Pugliese Stays Green and the strange brown-fruited variety that The Main Squeeze takes care of.
