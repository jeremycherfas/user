> I did not realize ‘mendacity’ was a 50-cent word. That’s what academic life has done to me.

A new film about evolution looks like fun, if the [NYT report](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/11/science/sciencespecial2/eager-to-tell-the-stories-of-science-a-biologist.html) is anything to go by. Randy Olson -- that’s him quoted above -- is a biologist turned film maker, whose [Flock of Dodos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800334/) lets scientists talk about evolution. I hope I get the chance to see it here.
