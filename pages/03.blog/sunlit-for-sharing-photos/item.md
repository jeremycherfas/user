After some discussion at IWC Berlin and online, I decided to download [Sunlit](https://sunlit.io/) to ease sharing photos. The good news is that it just works, out of the box, to send images to [my stream](https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/content/photos/). Once there, I can edit to enable sharing to Mastodon and off they go. I have not yet tried adding my Mastodon account as a second destination, because I want to be at least a little mindful and not post everything everywhere. One tiny criticism: when you add Alt text, the input box obscures the image. That makes it a little harder to describe the contents. Other than that, I'm very happy, and happy to move another step away from IG.
