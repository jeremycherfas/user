This morning, I brought in a 2006 item about [the world record for speed harvesting wheat](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/excitement-in-manitoba). In the course of checking old links, I discovered they’re still at it, most recently [in 2018](https://discoverwestman.com/articles/harvesting-world-record-smashed-in-winkler-with-303-combines-video), at least as far as I can tell.

> Philip Robertson, Guinness World Record Adjudicator, calls the day “an extraordinary event that raised lots of money for a great cause.”
> He confirms Winkler has fulfilled all the requirements for the record. “It was spectacular, 303 combine harvesters creating the most magnificent dust storm... it was wonderful to watch.”

I’ll bet. Three hundred and three combines cleared the field in under seven minutes.
