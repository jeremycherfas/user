<p class="highlight">It is an old truism that knowledge is power. The inverse — that power is often ignorance — is rarely discussed.</p>

<p class="highlight">When management knew, they generally did nothing until the fact that they had known was exposed. It is too soon to say what has changed, but this moment seems to mark a change in who is audible, which is to say, who is somebody.</p>
