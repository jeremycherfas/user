> The McRib’s unique aspects and impermanence, many of us believe, make it seem a likely candidate for being a sort of arbitrage strategy on McDonald’s part. Calling a fast food sandwich an arbitrage strategy is perhaps a bit of a reach – but consider how massive the chain’s market influence is, and it becomes a bit more reasonable.

I really like the kind of thinking Willy Staley puts into his piece [A Conspiracy of Hogs: The McRib as Arbitrage](https://www.theawl.com/2011/11/a-conspiracy-of-hogs-the-mcrib-as-arbitrage/). [^fn1] The idea the core business of McDonalds is not, in fact, food is wonderfully subversive. And reminds me of a great Planet Money podcast [How money got weird](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/09/30/140954343/the-friday-podcast-how-money-got-weird), in which Satyajit Das explained how, among other things, an airline company made all its money speculating on oil futures.

[^fn1]: And thanks Sam for the pointer.
