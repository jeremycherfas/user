Well, well, well. Cory Doctorow weighs in with a blistering [Why None Of My Books Are Available on Audible: And why Amazon owes me $3,128.55](https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff), which, deliciously, **is** available on Audible. Doesn’t help me in my desire to listen to [Elie Mystal’s Allow me to Retort](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/2022-07-30-12-30), but does make me even keener to avoid Audible.
