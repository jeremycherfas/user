Spent a more-or-less instructive week slowly moving this site over to its new home hosted at Hetzner. Not there yet, unless you’re reading this at some point in the future, but with a lot of help — and a lot of misdirection too — from ChatGPT we are getting closer. Some hard lessons to learn, which I will address in a more detailed write up, and despite a deluge of explanations, there are still many things about which my understanding is very shaky. Nevertheless, I am glad to be moving forward.
