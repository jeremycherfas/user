_This post is number 34 in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

Got into a slight cooking frenzy last night, which included a thick split pea and _pancetta_ soup that went straight into the fridge. And lo! This evening it was great to have on hand, having spent the day hard at work doing justice to the newly pruned potted lemon. Plants were repotted and moved to take advantage of the moving sun. Wires were stretched to accommodate the itchy feet of Virginia creeper and jasmine. I havenâ€™t felt that good tiredness, weariness rather than exhaustion, for a long while, and it was so fine. As was the split pea soup.
