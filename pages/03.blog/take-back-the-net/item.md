There's a new link over in my left hand menu: [Online Poker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker) [?](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/archives/2005/02/19/bloggers-of-the-world-unite/).

*23 July 2017: Obviously, 12 years on, this is no longer true. I'm leaving it here because it probably does as much good in the body of this post as it ever did in the blogroll.*

Have I gone mad? No. This is a really neat idea from [Planet Ozh](http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/archives/2005/02/19/bloggers-of-the-world-unite/) that might, if enough bloggers do it, result in the Wikipedia's entry for Online Poker being the top-ranked page for all searches for Online Poker.

What would be nice -- and alas I don't have the skill to do this -- would be for someone to start graphing the Wikipedia page's ranking to see whether this effort really does have an impact.
