Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.5 This week: 89.5

**Tuesday 9 October:** Things are settling down, and the appetite suppression seems to have mostly kicked in again after a couple of weeks of no oil. Mostly, because yesterday I had the oddest cravings for chocolate. A Magnum after lunch, a teeny bar of croccante, and then a small piece on the way home from work. Very odd indeed.
