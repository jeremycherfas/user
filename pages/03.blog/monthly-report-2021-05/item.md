Later than I’ve ever been, I think, thanks to The Client From Hell. Further proof, if proof were needed, that no amount of compensation is sufficient and also of that old adage:

! If a thing’s not worth doing, it’s not worth doing well.

Heigh ho.

## Highlights of the month:

- Repotted an orchid after reviving with weak tea for a week
- Discovered the pleasure of DIY fruit vinegars
- Got a new outdoor trable for the succulents
- Attended as much as I could of the virtual Hearsay Audio Festival. Some cracking award winners
- Took a teeny-weeny baby step into Jupyter
- Had a (malignant) mole removed
- My car got towed away, my own fault. Recovery relatively painless, but expensive
- Cultural quickie in Osta Antica with a simple picnic lunch

Cosmic doubts about working

### Activities

We’ve had a couple of social events, mostly dining outside with one or two friends, and that has been a lot of fun. Down in the Campo di Fiori on Saturday night we happened across a very rowdy mob of very loud youth. Apparently this sort of thing is officially called a _movido_, and while it wasn’t scary, at least not to me, it was unpleasant. A young girl was whaling on a boy with fists and boots, surrounded by a crowd egging them both on. Who knows?

The mole removal came with a no-workout warning, but an OK to walk with sticks, so I did, only to discover that there’s [no Nordic Walking workout](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/what-no-sticks) on the Apple watch. Seems like an oversight to me. Anyway, I enjoyed it, and might try to keep at it if I can.

I should note here too, though strictly speaking it took place in June, that after a 2.5 week break, it was a little hard to resume HIIT. The first session left me decidedly stiff and the second, this morning, seems anecdatally to have had slower heart rate recovery.

Impressive increase in naps.

### Work

It carried on carrying on and, as you may have gathered, really did keep me from doing some things I would really have preferred to be doing. Even now, on a Sunday afternoon, having done two things for myself, I’m conscious that tomorrow I have to deliver something else and a part of me wants to start that so I get a jump on tomorrow. 

Must. Resist.

### Goals

Five new posts, but no old ones. I was pleased with myself for finally having gotten around to writing [The truth about farro](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/the-truth-about-farro). I confess it would be nice to see it being linked to, but I’m not holding my breath.

### Niggles

I would just be repeating myself.

### Final remarks

The value of taking the time to put references into bibliographic software amply demonstrated when I had to do a complete reformat to submit to a different journal. Which rejected the paper with alacrity. So the value of etc. will be amply demonstrated next week to, as I reformat to submit to etc.
