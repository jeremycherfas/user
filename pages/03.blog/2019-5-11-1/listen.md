Episode summary: One summer in 1973, two men robbed a bank in Stockholm. They held four people hostage for six days. Swedish psychiatrist and criminologist Nils Bejerot coined the term “Stockholm Syndrome” to describe the response of the hostages. One of the bank robbers, Clark Olofsson, told us, “It was fun.” Special thanks to Terence Mickey, of the podcast Memory Motel, for allowing us to share audio from his interview with Kristin Enmark.
