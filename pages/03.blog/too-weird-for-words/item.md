Iâ€™m sure the good burghers of Rome, NY, are perfectly happy with this report in the [Utica Observer-Dispatch]~~http://www.uticaod.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070712/NEWS/70712015~~

> In other news, council members voted to designate a section of East Rome as the "Little Italy District."  
> Streets intersecting East Dominick Street, between Black River Boulevard and Panesi Avenue, will make up Rome's "Little Italy District."  
> The street signs also will be changed, beginning as early as the end of this week, to green signs with red letters. Signs also will read "Little Italy" in white.  
> Green, red and white are the colors of the Italian flag.  
> Councilman John Sparace, who sponsored the resolution, emphasized the importance of honoring the Italian immigrants who worked to develop Rome.

But for me it almost brought on a seizure as my poor brain tried to cope.

!!! 2022-08-13: Fruitless search for the original turned up no results (but a good laugh at leadlines like [Rome takes aim at improving recycling rate](https://eu.uticaod.com/story/news/2013/12/16/rome-takes-aim-at-improving/41537027007/)). Still, I know what I know, and I know I saw the article, and that it weirded me out. It also reminded me that I have long wanted to do a podcast on [Utica Greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica_greens).
