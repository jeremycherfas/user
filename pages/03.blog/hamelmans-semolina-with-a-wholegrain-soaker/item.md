I’d been longing to try one of those whole-grain soaker recipes for ages, but had to wait for the time to visit the whole foods shop to score some millet seeds; never seen them anywhere else. And then I had to wait another few days for a baking day. And a final delay of a week to post it all here. Ah well.

The recipe calls for a hot-water soaker and a “flying” sponge to go into the final dough, but as I had a hungry leaven that I wanted to feed and use I decided to use that to make the sponge, and to explain the calculations here in detail in case they might help someone. So, the recipe calls for:

## Soaker:
- Coarse cornmeal 80 gm (I used polenta)
- Millet seeds 60 gm
- Sesame seeds 60 gm
- Boiling water 250 ml

At least 4 hours before dough-time, pour the boiling water over the grains, cover with plastic wrap and allow to stand at room temperature.

## Sponge:
- Durum flour 200 gm
- Bread flour 200 gm
- Water 280 gm
- Yeast 17 gm fresh

You mix the two flours with the water and the yeast, stir it till everything is incorporated and then let it ripen at 25-26℃ for about 1.25 hours, until it is on the verge of collapse. But I wanted to use my leaven, which was nice and active, had been fed with bread flour and was at 100% hydration. I had 232 gm of starter, which represents 116 gm each of flour and water. So I needed to add 200-116=84 gm of bread flour, 200 gm of durum flour and 280-116=164 gm of water. Simple, no?
    
## Final dough:  

* All the soaker -- **do not drain!**
* All the sponge
* Durum flour 300 gm
* Bread flour 300 gm
* Water 260 gm
* Salt 22 gm

Hamelman calls for mechanical mixing, but I don’t have a machine, so I squidged all the ingredients together and left that to ferment for about 45 minutes. Tipped the dough out and did a stretch and fold, and although the dough was a bit sticky it was well structured and if I kept it on the move didn't actually stick **to** anything. Another 45 minutes bulk ferment and then I divided the dough into 3 equal pieces (about 660 gm each), pre-shaped them and let them rest for 15 minutes (I was doing everything by the book) before final shaping into loaves and proofing on a linen canvas cloth. When they had risen I tried a neat tip I picked up from Hamelman, to press the loaf onto a wet tea towel and then into a tray of sesame seeds. Works a treat. The third loaf I wet in the same way but then sprinkled poppy seeds on it. Finally slashed the loaves, two diagonally and one lengthwise, before slipping them into the oven at 230℃ (about the best my oven can do) with steam for the first 20 minutes and then without for a further 20 minutes.

The loaves were really delicious, the millet giving a very satisfying crunch. Not sure that I could taste the cornmeal, but as with so many of these things, I expect I'd miss it if it weren't there. All in all, well worthwhile, and the source of several delicious sandwich lunches.
