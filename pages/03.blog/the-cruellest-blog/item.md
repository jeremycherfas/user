From [Rebecca](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2006/03/certes_i_oghte_to_get_outte_mo.html), news of [Geoffrey Chaucer's blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20060401010709/http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/). As she says, one can almost read this, and right fun it is too. If life weren't quite so filled, I would linger longer, for sure.
