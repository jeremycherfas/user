I had a blog before I knew what a blog was. [The internet version](https://web.archive.org/web/20010202125500/http://www.futurefoods.com/) of a quarterly newsletter, lovingly hand-coded with table cells that looked like index card tabs, and every quarter I recoded everything to keep it up to date. Imagine my surprise when I joined a giant organization and discovered I’d have to do the same thing to publish a stream of press releases. No way. [The IT department could not understand.](https://2003.blogtalk.net/live.html) Still can’t. Seven years on and they’ve just finished day four of an upgrade to the CMS, which still isn't finished. And I [still](https://agro.biodiver.se/) [blog](http://www.vaviblog.com/).
