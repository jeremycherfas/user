Should I be beating myself up because we're more than halfway to the end of November? I don't think so. October was a good month, but not standout good. Maybe if it had been I would have written it up more rapidly. The high spot was definitely <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/indiewebcamp-nurnberg-2018" >IndieWeb Camp in Nürnberg</a >, and I did write that up reasonably quickly. No need to repeat here.

===

One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to a maker of traditional _Nürnberger Lebkuchen_ that Joschi Kuphal organised for me. It will be on Eat This Podcast in due course, early in December, and I found it absolutely fascinating. Of course, I couldn't have done it without <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://jkphl.is/" >Joschi</a >, and it was nice to able to share some lebkuchen with the people at IndieWeb Camp.

##Our Daily Bread

Still waiting to hear from Unbound whether they want to publish the book. Last month I said:

> My hope is to submit before the end of the coming week. I reacquainted myself with Scrivener to get going on this.

That was on 6 October. I made it with time to spare, on 15 October, so it has now been more than a month. Patience is hard, but if baking bread teaches anything, it is patience.

##Exist.io

Steps is still trending up, although a little more gently. Sixty-day rolling average on 28 October was 10,499 (spurious precision alert). Average time asleep also took a little jump towards the end of the month: 08:00. 

Not getting any hugely interesting correlations out of the app, but that's probably because I track such boring things. I have very little confidence in correlations between apects of the weather and anything I do, except possibly at the extremes. "You get more likes on Instagram when the night is cooler." M'kay. 

##Work

Logged 100 hours for the month and worked on 23 of the 31 days. There were a couple of paid projects in there, which is nice. I haven't found a way to account for time making or delivering bread, and I don't actually think I need to.

I've been reading up a bit about ways to display Edward Tufte styled sparklines for various activities, and it strikes me this could be a good starting point. But no firm goal yet.

###Goals

Six posts on this website, although two of those are sort of also old posts; a couple more than my admittedly low goal. Recorded _Reading_ on 16 days. That's OK; it means reading a book, not the computer,  for at least 30 minutes.


##Niggles

_Automate sharing from reading.am to Known. This is ready to go, just needs a `cron` job. However, the entire Read later, bookmark and annotate workflow needs dissection and implementation._ None of this really happened, but now that Known is accepting text in Bookmarks, it may be time.

Improve display of geographical information here would also be good, although I have been very bad at finding good stretches of time to get back into code.

##Final remarks

Life is good. I rate my mood as a 4 almost every day, with an occasional 5 and an even less frequent 3. Strictly speaking, this next should be in November's write-up, but I was amused to see that a single 3, the result of a [disastrous day pretending to know what I am doing in git](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/backing-away-slowly), prompted a dire summary from Exist.

> This week wasn't as good.
> 3.9 average mood last 7 days, 4 the prior week
