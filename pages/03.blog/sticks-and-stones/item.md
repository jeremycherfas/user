[Neddie is right](http://byneddiejingo.blogspot.com/2005/12/language-and-power.html) about the [speech Harold Pinter gave on accepting his Nobel prize for literature](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2005/pinter/25621-harold-pinter-nobel-lecture-2005/).

> Six of the most distinguished Jesuits in the world were viciously murdered at the Central American University in San Salvador in 1989 by a battalion of the Alcatl regiment trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. That extremely brave man Archbishop Romero was assassinated while saying mass. It is estimated that 75,000 people died. Why were they killed? They were killed because they believed a better life was possible and should be achieved. That belief immediately qualified them as communists. They died because they dared to question the status quo, the endless plateau of poverty, disease, degradation and oppression, which had been their birthright.

Neddie’s friends have been excising their favourite bits, and they’ve already taken mine. But the above will do nicely too, as a wonderful example of how to use words. Alas, unless something dramatic has changed, I don’t see those fine words doing any harm. Or these:

> How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred thousand? More than enough, I would have thought. Therefore it is just that Bush and Blair be arraigned before the International Criminal Court of Justice. But Bush has been clever. He has not ratified the International Criminal Court of Justice. Therefore if any American soldier or for that matter politician finds himself in the dock Bush has warned that he will send in the marines. But Tony Blair has ratified the Court and is therefore available for prosecution. We can let the Court have his address if they're interested. It is Number 10, Downing Street, London.

I was late to Neddie’s post, having been on the road, and would probably never have noticed Pinter’s speech otherwise. So, thanks to both.
