Clickety clackety click. Yes indeedy, I'm firing on all cylinders here, and the room resounds to the rat-a-tat of my spiffy new keyboard. It's a [Das Keyboard Model S Professional UK](https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/) and I love it to bits.[^fn1] As a typewriter, it's the best. Not just the noise but the spacing, pitch and feel of the keys is just lovely. The big problem is actually getting the keys to do what I expect them to do. I knew the layout would be the one favoured by all those other computer manufacturers, but I figured it would be reasonably easy to bend it to the will of my muscle memory. Not so. Getting the Â£ instead of the # was a doddle and I still need to swap @ and " around. But it has taken me forever to figure out how to get the keys in the bottom row working the way I'm used to, even with the help of a nifty little thing called [DoubleCommand](http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/).

One problem is the names for the bloody keys. The DoubleCommand innards don't make it easy to work out which key you want to act as which, but I did eventually get the ones that really matter  [^fn2] sorted out to my satisfaction. Couldn't they just give some simple options, like change this picture to that picture? That would work for me. I had no idea the Application key was even called that. I've never used it on the PC at work, and I can't think of anything to use it for here. Suggestions? And while I'm about it, will I ever get used to the media controls being where they are? Indeed, will I ever get used to even having media keys?

But you know, those really are niggles. I'm actually glad that my old iMac keyboard gave up the ghost. Now what I really want is two more of these suckers at work.

[^fn1]: I was even tempted, briefly, to upload a photo of it, but that passed. I mean, it is only a keyboard ... to look at. 

[^fn2]: Command and Control -- how neat is that?
