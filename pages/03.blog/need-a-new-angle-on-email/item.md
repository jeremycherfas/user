Apple told me to move all my stuff to iCloud and so, despite the fact that none of my mobile devices is able to take advantage of the magic that it supposedly represents, I went ahead. Now I have nothing but grief. In fairness, I was warned ...

GMail, which used to handily collect mail, will no longer do so. I tried forwarding mail from iCloud to GMail, but 12 hours later that does not seem to be working. So I'm in the market for a new email solution.

What would you recommend? Sparrow? Or something else?

I really liked GMail for two main reasons. First, its ability to collect and send mail from several different accounts. Secondly, natch, the search functions. And the giant storage didn't hurt either. So I'm looking for something like that. Might be standalone, might be web based; as long as it will stay synched among several machines and be easily available, I'm agnostic on that score.

Why did I bother, you might well ask. Not sure about that. I like my @mac.com address (though I wouldn't be seen dead using @me.com) and having a single identity across various Mac platforms. That, and inertia.

*p.s. 15 September 2017: I ended up with Fastmail.com, where I am more than happy to pay what it takes to be the customer not the product. It does all I need, and more.
