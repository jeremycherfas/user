In another cracking display of the impact of the UN’s [International Years of Waste](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/international-years-of-waste), May 30 will henceforth celebrate [International Potato Day](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-welcomes-decision-to-celebrate-international-day-of-potato-annually-on-may-30/en). It has been a while since the International Year of the Potato in 2008, but good things come to those who wait.

> The Day “will allow us to draw attention to the importance of this ancestral crop in sustaining efforts to reduce hunger, malnutrition and poverty; as well as to encourage agricultural development, food security, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functions,” Víctor García Toma, Permanent Representative of Peru to the United Nations told the General Assembly.

That’s a lot to ask, but if anyone can make it happen, the FAO can.
