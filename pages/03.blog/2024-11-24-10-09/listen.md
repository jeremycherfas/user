Episode summary: To kick off our new series on the history of bad ideas David talks to historian Sophie Scott-Brown about the idea of &lsquo;the silent majority&rsquo;, beloved by American presidents from Nixon to Trump. Where does this idea come from? Is it conservative or revolutionary? If the majority are actually silent, how can anyone know what they are thinking? And aren&rsquo;t the silent majority really the dead? Looking for Christmas presents? We have a special Xmas gift offer: give a subscription to PPF+ and your recipient will also receive a personally inscribed copy of David&rsquo;s new book The History of Ideas.
