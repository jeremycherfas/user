Things seem to be fully operational once more. You can get to the blog at www.jeremycherfas.net and at wp.jeremycherfas.net and at jeremycherfas.net/wp/ [^fn1]

At least, I think you can. I’m never absolutely sure, what with caching and everything.

To be honest, I don’t know what happened. And as the estimable [Otto42](http://ottodestruct.com/) said over at Wordpress support, “What you've explained so far is basically a horrific mess.” Well, horrific is maybe pushing it, but, as I admitted, I know enough to screw up royally, and just about enough, with the help he offered, to fix it again. At least, I think so ...

One thing remains, not that I care.[^fn2] I’ve heard that Google will actually penalize me for having many URIs pointing to the same content. Is that so? Can anyone tell me how to avoid that, if I want to?

[^fn1]: I'm not going to link to those; Google might think I've gone spam-mad. 

[^fn2]: Much.
