Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.1  This week: 86.7  
**Wednesday 11 October:** A very kind friend reminded me of the need to drink more water, and it is true that with the onset of cooler weather I might not have been drinking as much as before. That and the lack of water hidden in food surely contribute to constipation. So, in addition to the All Bran, I am also making a conscious effort to drink more water. Not very scientific, I know, manipulating more than one variable at a time, but needs must,  and it seems to be working.

**Tuesday 17 October:** A somewhat strange thread over on the SLD forums, polling readers about how often they weigh[^1] and what impact that might have on their weight loss, prompted me to update my own little graph. I weigh daily, first thing in the morning, when I am at home. I somehow manage to fool myself into treating every drop as important and every increase as insignificant, and on a day-to-day basis that's fine. Every now and again (6-8 weeks, so far) I stick all the numbers into a spreadsheet and calculate a simple linear regression, mostly just because I can. The latest results are [here](weight-loss-2.png). As for my evacuatory troubles, they’re much better, thank you, but it is so easy to forget to drink enough. I’ve taken to filling a large bottle and keeping it on my desk, rather than wandering off to the water cooler, mug in hand. I think that works better.
