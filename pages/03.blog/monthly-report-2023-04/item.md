It was a good month, although an early spell of good weather rather lulled me into thinking that spring had sprung, only for April to go out like a lion.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- The [academic paper was published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912423000196) to no substantive objection. Yet
- Negative biopsy. Yay!
- Excellent visit to old friends in Brussels, plus recorded an episode of ETP there
- Dismantled the old bike completely (with professional help) and started to fix things up
- Fine visit from an old friend and colleague, and her daughter and mother
- Made actual use of ChatGPT to write a little program
- A succession of successful snail hunts on the terrace
- One piece of paid work, and that was plenty

### Stuff Done

Still getting loads of spam to just one or two posts, despite having deleted all previous spam comments, so I guess the spammers are not actually monitoring anything, just blasting their crap out willy nilly. I cannot think of anything more soul-crushing.

On the bike restoration, I oscillate madly between the fantasy of wanting to lovingly fix absolutely every original part and the reality of knowing that I definitely don't have the patience and likely don't have the skills or resources. I'm currently stalking eBay for a replacement saddle, a quill stem and a left crank, having discovered to my astonishment that the cranks are ill-matched, with a right of 165mm and a left of 170mm. Never noticed that before now.

Splurged out on Keyboard Maestro, in order to use a single macro that converts Bike outline files into Markdown files, and am finding it very much harder to understand or, dare I say it, grok, than I anticipated. I've built a couple of little things to speed my chores, fractionally, but I'm torn between accepting it was an expensive purchase and spending yet more for a tutorial course.

#### Hours logged per month

### Goals

Nine posts here, which will do nicely. `$project` got absolutely no attention, and that needs to be fixed. The little automations I built were satisfying.

### Niggles

Not too many this month. I would still like to be a bit more disciplined about blocking time for things, but I am not beating myself up about it.

### Final remarks

Not too bothered about the lack of Twitter as I do seem to be able to follow lists. So maybe I need to put more people into one list or the other.
