I haven't seen that video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing her ass off, and nor will I, but kudos to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://www.wired.com/story/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dancing-video/" >Wired</a > for using it as a peg on which to hang a good story about copyright, mash-ups, fair use and the like.

===

The story is worth reading for its own sake, but what struck me was what happened to Sarah Newhouse, the woman who created the mash-up that the video of Ocasio-Cortez (and many other videos) was copying.

> Meanwhile, Newhouse, who created the original Breakfast Club/Phoenix mashup, says her entire YouTube account has since been deleted—for copyright infringement. “It was a three strikes rule, I got three copyright claims and poof!”[^1]

She's still around, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/3x1minus1) and on YouTube, where she reposted [the original mash-up "from the og"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlLKG_8sHF8). Does that really mean that she didn't have the original any more? Doesn't bear thinking about.
