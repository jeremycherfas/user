On a recent flight, I read two articles that had been festering in my to-read list. 

===

[How Google builds it maps -- and what it means for the future of everything](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/) is, as friends have said, astonishing. I was suitably amazed at how many people it takes to absorb human intelligence and layer that onto geodata. 

Then I read [How Walk Score puts a number on walkability](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/walking/2012/04/walking_in_america_how_walk_score_puts_a_number_on_walkability_.html), part of a Slate series on Walking in America, and learned that Walk Score is bedevilled by problems that arise from relying on software rather than intelligence. And I wondered, how long before Google tarmacs over Walk Score. 

Perhaps [crowdsourcing the intelligence overlay](https://web.archive.org/web/20121005142958/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kbenfield/walk_score_gets_interactive_ma.html)[^1] will solve Walk Score's problems, although a quick glance at their offerings for Rome suggests not. 

[^1]: Original link dead. Found thanks to the Internet Archive. You're welcome.

And then, this morning, Nicola Twilley's wonderful Edible Geography blog brought me [The Spatial Distribution of Americans in Relationship to Starbucks](http://www.ediblegeography.com/the-spatial-distribution-of-americans-in-relationship-to-starbucks/). Take that approach to walkability and you might be getting somewhere.
