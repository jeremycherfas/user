Episode summary: How to get the best value from the salad bar? Why do Americans refrigerate their eggs? What’s the deal with Choco Pies? It’s the food edition of listener questions.

I don't recall asking for this myself, and Lord knows there's enough one can say about food and economics without this level of absurdity. Indeed, Planet Money used to do a really good job of that.

I'm outta here, after a long, long time, and on the hunt for a new way to learn about economics.
