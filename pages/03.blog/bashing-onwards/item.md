Inspired by the latest episode of <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/automators-31-making-your-screenflow-flow-and-more-with-j-f-brissette/" >the Automators podcast</a >, I did two things. First, I started istening to the Taming the Terminal series that they recommended. So far so good. More practically, I created a *bash alias* for a couple of commands that I use almost every day. They use `rsync` to save a copy of a couple of important sites locally, and in the way of such things the commands are complex with many moving parts. Until now, I've kept them in a text file, and copied and pasted when I wanted to run them. This time, I copied and pasted into `.bash_profile`. Yay me! Time and keystrokes saved. Yay Automators!

Next I really want to learn how to tell `bash` to send me an email with the results of a command it has carried out.
