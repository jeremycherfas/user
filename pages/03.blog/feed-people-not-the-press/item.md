You have presumably seen the storm in a little red cup over Elon Musk's offer to send about $6 billion to the World Food Program if “WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger”. Of course the Director of the WFP pointed out that the headline misrepresented him, natch, and that $6 billion “will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation.”

And he has now [come up with an itemised budget](https://www.newsweek.com/united-nations-calls-elon-musks-bluff-unveils-plan-spend-his-66b-world-hunger-relief-1650062).

===

While we wait (and wait) to see how that plays out, I'm reminded of my own little fantasy, written 12 years ago after another [empty gesture at ending hunger](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/food-news-new-series-15-strike-one). I wondered what would happen if, instead of merely foregoing one meal, big fucking deal, rich people sent the cost of that meal to poor people. I reckoned it would raise about $2.5 billion, as a low estimate. I also [fantasised about delivering the cash direct](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/mobile-phones-make-it-work) to people who need it, via their phones.

So, yeah, here’s my meal, hungry people. I trust [GiveDirectly to give my money to people who need it](GD-letter.pdf), and I trust them to spend it however they want.
