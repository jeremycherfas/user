  * [Someone has adopted this little bottle of orange detergent and is trying to hide it from everyone else!](https://ok-cleek.com/blogs/?p=2964) This is just the most seductive tale of office life I have read in a long time. (I know, I don't get out much.)[^1]

  
  * ~~[A friend marveled to me today how the Europeans pride themselves on choosing leaders who are their best and brightest, where we mock our best and brightest and go for the guy near the bottom of his class. Bill Clinton “the Rhodes Scholar“ was an exception, and all we got from that was eight years of peace and prosperity, a strong dollar, and the respect of the world.](http://www.andrewtobias.com/cgi-local/display_col.pl?080904)~~ I’m not sure his friend is entirely correct, but the rest of Andrew Tobias’ post makes for very sound reading.
