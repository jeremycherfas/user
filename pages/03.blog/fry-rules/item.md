! 2022-06-14: Sorry to say, most of theis post is pointless today. The collection of Futurama taglines is gone and the chap who made it, while [still on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/nachop/), did not go pro, and maybe that's why the set vanished. Too bad. 

Futurama fans, go [here]~~http://www.flickr.com/photos/nachop/sets/450093/~~, and give thanks, in Spanish, to [Sr Nacho](https://web.archive.org/web/20220319155445/https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/peliculas-tv/futurama-taglines.html).

One problem with hanging around in front of del.ici.ous instead of, say, watching dirty movies, is that you find stuff like [this bloke](https://web.archive.org/web/20061013004114/http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/things.html) and the things he argues with his grilfriend about and the whole evening drifts by.
