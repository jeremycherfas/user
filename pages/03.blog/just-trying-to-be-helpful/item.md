On the road, and discovering the joys of connectivity in various places, one thing puzzles me. How come Google can remember what language I want my searches in, but not the language in which I want Reader to deal with me? In Italy, Reader has gone all Italian on me, while in Belgium it veered randomly between French and Flemish. Amusing, while it goes, and maybe if I were paying attention I’d now know how to say “Mark all as read” in those languages. But seriously, is Google being helpful, or lazy? If it knows my preferred language in one of its realms, why not in the others?

Hungary, however, breaks that rule. Google itself is present in Hungarian, but it has decided to show me Reader in English. I expect it knows that while I might stand a chance with French and Dutch, there’s no way I could manage Magyar.
