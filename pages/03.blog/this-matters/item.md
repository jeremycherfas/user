“Don't let anyone use ‘ID’ and ‘theory’ in the same sentence.” Sage advice from R. Joe Brandon, organizer of a petition to muster scientists against the teaching of intelligent design in science lessons. The Petition raised 7733 signatures, mine among them, in just four days. the Discovery Institute took four years to raise just 400 names.

Gilder: "Overthrows Darwin at the end of the 20th century in the same way that quantum theory overthrew Newton at the beginning."
