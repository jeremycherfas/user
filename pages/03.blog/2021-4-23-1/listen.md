Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX. A note on notes: We’d much rather you just went into each episode of The Memory Palace cold. And just let the story take you where it well. So, we don’t suggest looking into the show notes first. Music: Individuation by Eluvium Kola - Lighthouse Version by amiina Seeming by Helios Portrait Gallery by Luke Howard Disillusionment for the Emotional Type by You’ll Never Get to Heaven Clouds by Hiroshi Yoshimura Notes: Leviathan: the History of Whaling in America by Eric Jay Dolan was super useful and very readable. You can find the study on Sperm Whale adaptation in the North Pacific here.
