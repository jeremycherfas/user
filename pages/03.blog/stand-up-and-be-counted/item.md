Interesting times on the atheism front. Martin Amis is on top form in a wonderful essay called [The Age of Horrorism](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/10/september11.politicsphilosophyandsociety). I can't possibly do it justice, and wouldn’t dare to précis, so just go and read. ([Part two](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/10/september11.politicsphilosophyandsociety1) and [Part three](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/10/september11.politicsphilosophyandsociety2).) Then there's Richard Dawkins' new book The God Delusion. I have not yet had time to read it, yet, but [The Economist's review](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2006/09/21/misbegotten-sons) makes me long to.

> The problem, as Mr Dawkins sees it, is that religious moderates make the world safe for fundamentalists, by promoting faith as a virtue and by enforcing an overly pious respect for religion. (Why is it easier for a Quaker to avoid combat duty as a conscientious objector than someone who simply deplores violence?)

And, I might ask, why are Jewish and Muslim butchers allowed to kill animals in a manner that a Christian or atheist are not? Salon had an excellent [long interview with Dawkins](https://web.archive.org/web/20121119035112/http://www.salon.com/2005/04/30/dawkins/) in April 2005, which The Economist thoughtfully links to.

Best for last, though. An utterly delightful treat on NPR's music podcast for 16 September, which I only got round to this morning. Someone called Chris Smither, whom I am ashamed to admit I had never heard of, played a wonderful song called Origin of Species from his new album [Leave the Light On](https://smither.com/).

Naturally neither Richard Dawkins nor I would ever agree with Smither's final conclusion, but that's a quibble. If, as The Economist suggests, The God Delusion “should help bring the atheists out of the closet,” we'll need a rallying song. _Pace_ [The Vatican Rag](vatican-rag.mp3), Origin of Species is the best I've come across. Thank you NPR and Chris Smither.
