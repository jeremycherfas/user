A few weeks ago, a professional broadcaster asked me how I managed to get such good audio quality on an episode of Eat This Podcast. Once I'd got over the shock, I just told her that it was Skype (and a teeny bit of judicious tweaking). Every time Skype gives me any kind of trouble, I take a deep breath and tell myself, again, that it is simply a miracle that such a thing exists.

Then I put together the [most recent episode](http://eatthispodcast.com/whiskynomics) in which, for a variety of reasons, I was not able to use Skype to talk to the person I'm interviewing, and I wonder first how anyone can ever understand a phone call these days and secondly, whether anyone will be able to stand that audio quality on the show. Again, I have to take a deep breath and tell myself that content trumps quality and that it is simply a miracle to be able to produce and publish audio content all on my own.
