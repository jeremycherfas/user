Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.? This week: 89.0  
Tuesday 23 January: OK, I've been buggering about this 88 or 89 level for way too long now. I have my reasons, of course, but I think the time has come to make a serious push lower. Yesterday, after returning from a trip, I was at the supermarket shopping when I was struck by an overwhelming desire for Brussels sprouts for dinner. Naturally I yielded, as they had some dinky little punnets. It was odd, preparing them with nary a turkey (or goose) in sight, but they were delicious, with just a little butter and a sprinkling of sesame seeds. (Note to self: sesame oil.) It cannot have been that I was craving greens. I've been eating good salads all week. Can one crave a brassica? I guess so.
