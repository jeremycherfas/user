Back in the swing of things and managing to keep on top of everything. A run of glorious weather (ongoing) makes the cold within bearable because we can also go outside to warm up. Weird.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- Terrific couple of weeks away, including ...
- ... great visit with a friend of very long standing.
- A week of remedial eating (minestrone etc).
- Added a stand to a bicycle and raised the handlebars; much comfier.
- Some fine nights with friends.
- Read *Orwell's Roses* by Rebecca Solnit, a total delight.
- Two lovely gentle movies, Perfect Days and The Holdovers.
- Bicycle ride for Holocaust Memorial Day.
- Sharpened my axe; worthwhile.

Previous years are on [an archive page](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/working-life).

Current me would like to thank past me for showing unusual foresight, which made updating the scripts to produce the graphs easier than expected.

### Goals

Nine posts this month, which is nice.

### Niggles

None, really, but then it was a very easy month.

### Final remarks

Hard to know what to tackle in the way of something larger. `$project` languishes, for now, paralysed in part by indecision about the CMS behind it. Cleaning up this site by hiving off some of the podcast posts would be a good thing. WithKnown continues to thwart me at times but not quite at the point where I want to start over. Still, for all that, spring is springing.
