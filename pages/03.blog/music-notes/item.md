Having whined recently about listening to music and finding music I want to listen to I resolved, casually, to do something about that. A couple of days ago, I took a look at Bandcamp to see what they thought I might like, based on what I have liked. The first thing they sent me to was OK, but not right for purchase. That, however, sent me to [Promises by Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/promises). It struck me as an interesting hybrid of minimalist ambient and (not very) hard bop, and I was happy to buy it. After a couple more listens, I remain glad I did.

And then, this week, my sister-in-law returned the Apple Superdrive I had lent her several years ago, when my machine still had a built in drive and her’s did not. I still have loads of physical CDs not yet ripped, and as a result not heard for years. Alas, I could not even insert a CD. After a lot of jiggery-pokery involving Safe Mode and various incantations, none of which worked. I just started trying every single one of the outboard USB-B sockets. Only one apparently worked, and that one provoked a message about needing more power. So then I tried the built-in USB C, with an adapter. The first didn’t work, and I was about to give up, but in a spirit of no compromise I tried the final socket. Blow me if the Superdrive didn’t just show up, bold as day. I ripped a test CD and am currently listening to it.

This is the way.
