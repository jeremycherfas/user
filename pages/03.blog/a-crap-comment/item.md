If I were in the least bit insecure about this blog, I would welcome comments like this one:

> First of all thank you for a such wonderfull topic, well i have to say it is difficult for me to say if i agree with you or not. I will read it for a second time and let you know what i think

Sure, it’s content free. But hey! Somebody cares! Except, of course, that they don’t. Pure spam bollox. Best of all, it was a comment to a post that wasn’t a topic at all, it was just a list of links. So the good news is that if the spammers are paying real people to post real comments, they’re getting ripped off too.
