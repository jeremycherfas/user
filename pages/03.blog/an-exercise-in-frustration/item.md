Lockdown has boosted my motivation to do some organised exercise, and as a mark of progress, I have a new frustration. I started off doing the 7-minute High Intensity thing a few months back (having lapsed on the Canadian 5BX a few months before that). I liked it, and I like the [app I settled on from Johnson & Johnson](https://www.7minuteworkout.jnj.com/). It worked well for me but today, having been doing a 7-minute circuit almost daily for a little more than two weeks, I ran into a niggle.

Time to up my effort, I thought. The app offers lots of variety, but there are exercises in the 8- and 9-minute circuits that I just cannot do.[^1] So, harking back to the previous epoch when I did circuits daily, I thought, best to just do two circuits. Weirdly, however, the app doesn’t offer two cycles, only three. OK, so I set off on three cycles, figuring that I would just stop after two, which I did, only to discover that neither of those two were recorded. If you give up, even if you had planned to give up, you get _nul points_.

OK, I’m am old geezer now, I shouldn’t need the additional reward of an automated record in my Health app, but hey, it’s all part of motivation and progress. What to do? I could just stop after two and know that the automated record is wilfully wrong. I could contruct my own two-cycle customised workout, but that’s a lot of faff. I could just do two separate cycles one after the other (which is probably what I will do). Or I could wonder out loud why the Johnnson & Johnson 7M Workout app does not have a two-cycle workout.
