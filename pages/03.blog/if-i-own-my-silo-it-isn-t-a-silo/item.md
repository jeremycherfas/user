Over at <a href="https://matigo.ca/2017/05/27/what-real-problem-am-i-trying-to-solve" class="u-in-reply-to">his personal blog</a>, Jason has this to say:

<blockquote>What could possibly make 10C better than WordPress with a myriad of plugins? Despite what people might want from the 10C platform, it is a silo. Even in v5, which involves a globally distributed system of servers operated by anybody who might want to participate, the system is a silo. A silo that anybody could operate, but a silo nonetheless.</blockquote>

The title of this post is my answer. 

Keeping stuff around for millennia is great, but that's not what attracts most people to 10C. What attracts them is the community and the sense that there are real people who are really involved. Personally, I think Jason is too responsive to every little thing that some user thinks might be cool, and while he gives great service to those users, interoperability, openness, whatever, is -- again personally -- much more useful. To me.

That's why I hope V5 of 10C is fully IndieWeb capable.
