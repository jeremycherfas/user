Back in 1998 the Royal Agricultural Society of England asked me to write an article for a little booklet designed to feed the debate on genetically engineered crops. My chapter --  Nothing new under the sun -- duly appeared. I’ve often had cause to think about it, and to reflect that I rather like it, and stand by it today. In fact, while it could undoubtedly be updated, on re-reading I don’t think that is necessary.

The original can still be found on the web, but it isn’t easy, so I thought I would upload it [here](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/work/nothing-new).
