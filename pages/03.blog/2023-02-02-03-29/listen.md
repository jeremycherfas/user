Episode summary: Alex Fink think we already have enough information on the web: now it&rsquo;s time to make sense of all of it. He&rsquo;s built a fantastic tool called Otherweb that uses natural language processing to aggregate news from reputable outlets and filter out the junk. It even includes a search engine that can exclude any articles with affiliate links, hateful content, or lacking references. Oh and he&rsquo;s built all of this without developing a business model.
