I’ve noticed that many blogs hosted on Blogspot are unavailable here. Behind the times as I often am, it took a quick Google to discover that they are indeed banned, and not just here, apparently, but also in Pakistan and India. All of them? I suppose that’s the only way. There appeared to be a redirect service at ~~[http://www.inblogs.net/](http://www.inblogs.net/)~~ but it doesn't seem to work. ~~[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/)~~, by contrast, does seem to be available. sometimes there may be advantages to being not all that big.

_p.s._ I am ~~[sooooo proud!](http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&fr=hptb&p=bear+do+shit+in+wooods)~~

! 2021-09-25: This whole post is like a time capsule from 2007. None of the links works. WordPress is now way bigger than Blogspot. And my prideful link to a photo I took of bear shit in the woods in no longer anywhere to be seen, rather like Yahoo search.
