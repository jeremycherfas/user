An unsolicited email from The Information Portal for the Public Sector promises amusement:

> **"We can't be anti everything!"**  
> The UK Government's new Energy Adviser, David MacKay, gives a sound bite-free overview of the sustainable energy debate 

Love the exclamation point. Love even more the toothlessness of ~~[Mr MacKay's overview](http://www.publicservice.co.uk/article.asp?publication=Science%20and%20Technology&id=390&content_name=Energy&article=12124)~~.[^1] Or should that be overbite? Ah, the perils of half-baked [hyphenation](https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/hyphens-in-phrasal-adjectives/).

[^1]: 2021-09-23: Darn but that's a shame. No trace anywhere of the article, though I did find [this](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/david_j_c_mackay_550284); the site looks pickled in aspic.
