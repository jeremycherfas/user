I rant regularly when people abuse Latin binomials by adding an unnecessary article in front of them, like people who refer to "the _acanthomyops latipes_". As I [said at the time][jeremycherfas]: 

> While I happily refer to the Skidelskys, I would never dream of calling them the Edward Skidelsky and the Robert Skidelsky. How hard is it to use a Latin name as a name?

Now I have a new term with which to beat people over the head. Thanks to a very informative article by Geoffrey K. Pullum over at Language Log ([Glenn Frey and the band with the anomalous name][ldc]) I now know not only that the band was called Eagles, not The Eagles, and also that such a thing -- "which takes no _the_" -- is called a strong proper name.

P.s. The comments on the Language Log post reveal that many bands, some of which I've even heard of, apparently have strong proper names, Talking Heads being my favourite.
