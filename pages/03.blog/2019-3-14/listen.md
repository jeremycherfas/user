Episode summary: CBD Gummies, CBD croissants, CBD coffee, CBD pesto, CBD beer… CBD is everywhere. Presenter Charlotte Smith tells the story of how this oil from cannabis that doesn’t get you high is becoming the biggest buzzword in food and drink from its beginnings in the US with the legalisation of medical cannabis through to the proliferation of products on the market today that claim to help with everything from pain to public speaking. Can it live up to the hype? Charlotte heads to the UK’s first cannabis-infused restaurant, Brighton’s Canna Kitchen, to try it for herself. Producer: Tom Bonnett
