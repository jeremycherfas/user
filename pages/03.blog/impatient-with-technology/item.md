_This post is number XX in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

I didn’t think I would be, but I’m really rather peeved by the way my WordPress update worked out. And not just WordPress. There seems to be an obsession with making things more complicated -- possibly just for the sake of it -- rather than with making them work better. It used to be easy to upload pictures and insert them in a post. Now it isn’t just difficult; it’s impossible. Maybe if it had never been easy I wouldn’t care. I’m sure everyone is beavering away behind the scenes to fix something that wasn’t broken anyway, but I’m getting impatient. Please guys.
