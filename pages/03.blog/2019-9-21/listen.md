Last week sometime I saw a reference to this podcast, which mentioned the name of the show in disparaging terms, but was otherwise an endorsement. Worth listening to a single epsiode, then. About 10 minutes through I was about to give up, but as I was walking hard I decided not to bother fiddling and I'm glad I did. George offers an insight into a world I know absolutely nothing about and that is clearly important. It isn't going to be an easy listen, I expect, but it is going to be interesting. Subscribed.
