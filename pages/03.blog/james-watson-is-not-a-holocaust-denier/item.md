I Googled “+Ahmadinejad +Watson” and was pretty astounded to find almost nothing. Doing the same on Blogsearch[^1] provided three items. 

- [Undemocracy in America] ~~http://undemocracy.blogspot.com/2007/10/ahmadinejad-1-watson-0.html~~
- [Wired Blog Network](https://www.wired.com/2007/10/british-science/), and
- [Sweetness and Light](https://web.archive.org/web/20101118232932/http://sweetness-light.com/archive/lab-suspends-watson-for-his-thought-crimes)

All make the comparison that for a couple of weeks I have thought way too obvious to bother here with. But really, the Iranian President is given a hero’s welcome at Columbia University, while pusillanimous scientists censor one of their own?

You couldn’t make it up.
