[Wheel](http://byneddiejingo.blogspot.com/2006/04/et-in-arcadia-ego.html), meet butterfly.

Pal Neddie has done a bang-up job on _The Da Vinci Code_, including introducing someone to the word cackhanded, testimony to Nedâ€™s own time in foreign fields. I have not, myself, picked up the aforementioned book, and would sooner suck out my own eyeballs than read it, so I cannot vouch for the accuracy of his comments. But he seems to make a _prima facie_ case, as we legaloids like to say.
