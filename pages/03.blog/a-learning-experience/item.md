A fine evening, as a Philistine among the anointed. My first exposure to the term “appropriation art” though not, I subsequently discovered, to appropriation art itself. Some of it I think I understand, the visual equivalent of musical sampling. Some I definitely don’t, the [artistic equivalent of straightforward theft](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/sherrie-levine-2753).[^1] As ever, the web leaves me better informed, but no wiser. I give you:

  * [An Establishment’s View](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/appropriation)
  * [An Artist's View](https://web.archive.org/web/20040617044216/http://www.othercinema.com/otherzine/otherzine6/prelinger.html)
  * [A Lawyer's View] ~~http://culturalpolicy.uchicago.edu/conf1999/landes.html~~

Maybe you can make more sense of it than I can.

But the high point of the evening was most definitely wandering into the bathroom at the trattoria where we ended up for supper, and seeing a sign that read “Uomini Man”. For one, brief moment I thought I was in some sort of hipster paradise. But no, that’s where I had been earlier in the evening.

[^1]: 2021-10-28: Back when I wrote this post, the Tate’s entry on Sherrie Levine included one of her appropriated images, with the deliciously ironic note: “Sorry... image not available, due to copyright restrictions”.  
Perfect, simply perfect.
