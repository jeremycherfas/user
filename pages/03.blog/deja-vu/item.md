> Purpose, shmurpose. I'm just going to enjoy them.

An [article](http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/04/24/orgasmic_science/) in the Boston Globe reviews a new book on the (evolutionary) purpose of the female orgasm. Bottom line: it ain’t got one. I seem to recall having read similar comments before. Now where was that? Oh yes, I remember. [I wrote them](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140294759/qid=1116405909/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_10_3/202-0409817-2376609).
