The dough rose, was knocked down, rose again, and was baked. It was crusty. It tasted of sour dough. It was good. God, how I love practical biotechnology!

One strange thing; the dough seems to have become much more liquid as it proved. I'm guessing that this could be because I covered the bowl, loosely, with a plastic bag. Maybe in this heat the ferment generated a whole lot of water vapour that just couldn't escape? I had to add at least a couple of ounces of flour to get it back into shape, and I know it was OK when I left it last night. Anyway, next time -- which better be pretty soon to keep things bubbling along -- I'll try covering it just with a cloth.

A blasted car alarm has been screeching for over an hour. That's going to make sleeping fun.

_P.s. I now know that it probably was not the heat and the plastic bag. More likely, it was simply over-proofed. The enzymes can apparently turn on the gluten and destory the network. Who knoew?_
