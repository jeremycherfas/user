In my as yet completely unsuccessful attempt to [revive an internet meme](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/breathing-life-into-a-blog-meme-maybe), I was somewhat sketchy on the idea of planets, mostly because they were not something I ever used. I suggested that they were automatic accretions, without detailed curation. I was wrong, as Fluffy pointed out when a group of us couldn’t quite get the history straight. Fluffy rambled about [Planet Planet](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/8400-Planet-Planet) and set us straight.

> Planet Quake … was a hand-curated collection of all the news about the game Quake.

TIL.
