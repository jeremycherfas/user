I may regret this, but having learned to spread little goodies to followers through Google Reader, I thought I would send them back here to The Mother Ship. Over there, below the Random Photograph. To do that, however, I have to make them available to all and sundry, rather than just to my friends and followers there. Now this is weird; if I want to share through my blog, why shouldn’t I just add that as a condition to Google Reader? Still, it is worth a try. If I drown in a sea of undesirable comments (fat chance) I know where to find a lifebelt.
