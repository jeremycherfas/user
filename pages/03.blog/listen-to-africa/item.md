I’ve been devoting my morning and evening commutes to catching up with TEDTalks, which had been languishing since last autumn. Yesterday and today I was simply blown away by three in succession.

  * [George Ayittey](https://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/151): fire and brimstone
  * [Patrick Awuah](https://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/156): learning and leadership
  * [Chris Abani](https://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/155): laughter and hope

Of course, to call them African is to miss the point. Two Ghanaians and a Nigerian. An Ibo and two -- what? Three fine, passionate, inspiring, wonderful speakers.

The intertubes are so, so wonderful. And there’s lots more about those three and everyone else at the TED site.
