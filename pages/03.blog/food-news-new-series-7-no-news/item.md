Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.8 This week: 90.1

A long weekend away, with a decent Indian, a wedding feast, fine home cooking with friends, and then the world’s saltiest (and tastiest) little lamb chops last night -- of course I’m heavier. But I’m sure tomorrow’s scale will tell a different story. Alas, though, I have no other story to tell today. I need to try harder to have something timeless on the back burner, as it were, as I used to when the Royal Mail delivered my copy fortnightly.
