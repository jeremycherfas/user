I am in a mess, and for a whole slew of different reasons. This afternoon, a few minutes ago, I recognised a definite warning sign. In pursuit of doing something new and different, I got completely stuck in *how* to do it instead of *what* to do. Classic prevarication. Figure out a way to make the process more efficient before I have even decided what the outcome of the process should be. So I spent the better part of an hour futzing around with Workflow on the iPhone to see whether I could send some information directly to a nascent bit of *what*. And why? Because simply emailing the information and then using that as the basis for a bit of *what* seemed clumsy. It isn't.

Well, it is, but it will at least get the job done.

At least, it will if I let myself let it.
