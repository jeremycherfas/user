The cynic in me says that talkfests like [World Food Day](https://www.fao.org/righttofood/index_en.htm) are just that: talkfests. We meet so you can eat, but nothing actually changes as a result. So I was brought up a little short by a post over at [Greens & Berries](http://greensandberries.squarespace.com/greens-and-berries/2007/10/18/world-food-day-2007-the-right-to-food.html). World Food Day seems actually to have influenced the way one person thinks, and as she formulates and achieves her plans, may have an impact on the people she works with. Thatâ€™s heartening, and I feel suitably humbled.

I wish Elaine strength, and hope other people are similarly moved to real action.
