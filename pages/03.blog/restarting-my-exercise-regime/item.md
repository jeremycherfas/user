Today I did some high intensity interval training for the first time since 22 July. First there was some very minor surgery, then a wonderful couple of weeks in the countryside where I swam every day instead. So, after a gap of 46 days, it was time to get going again.

And it was tough.

I got through my easier set, which I used to alternate with a harder set, but it was close. In fact, I think I’m going to give it a week of easier before I get back into alternating.

A couple of interesting points. My watch makes it easy to track heart rate and heart rate recovery, and on both measures I am not as fit as I was seven weeks ago, but there really isn’t much in it. Also, swimming feels much easier, even though it burns about the same number of calories per minute. By the end of the holiday, I was swimming over a kilometre, and taking about 45 minutes to do that. As a result, what with throwing in a walk too on some days, I broke my previous Move record twice. But that did not make it any easier to restart HIIT.
