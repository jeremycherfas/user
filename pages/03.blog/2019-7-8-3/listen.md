Episode summary: Hello Citizens! It’s almost summer vacation season (at least in North America) so for this month’s Plus we asked producers something that might help YOU plan a few summer getaways. In this episode, you’ll hear: Ian Chillag, Roman Mars, Helen Zaltzman, Nikki Silva, Dave Nadelberg, Manoush Zomorodi, Jen Poyant, Joe Richman, Davia Nelson, Phoebe Judge and Lauren Spohrer. We’ve paired all of the recommendations with episodes over on the blog. Lastly: We wanted to remind you…we have Radiotopia merch for sale! Grab a t-shirt and wear it on one of your summer getaways. Or, grab a camping mug and bring it to the campfire. Podcasts, coffee, the great outdoors. What could be better?
