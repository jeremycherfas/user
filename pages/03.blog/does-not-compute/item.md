So I really want to be green, mercy yes,  save the ecology and all, offset my carbon emissions. And I’m really anti-GM. Playing God, y’know, and besides it makes Indian farmers commit suicide and kills rats, right? So, how do I deal with [this news](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/08/gmcrops.food)? 

> Money paid by green consumers to offset their flights and by companies that go carbon-neutral will be used to fund the planting of genetically modified (GM) crops under plans drawn up by a US biotechnology company.

Arcadia Biosciences is working with the Chinese government to reward farmers in China that grow the firm’s genetically modified (GM) rice, with carbon credits that they can sell for cash. 

I mean, it’s giving me a real headache.
