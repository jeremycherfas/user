Good to see that big tech employees feel no need to hide their dirty laundry away. Tim Bray over at Ongoing has an update on the [simple observation that Microsoft’s Developer Network website contains horrible code](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/26/Fair-is-Fair). So does Sun, where he works. And IBM. I’m by no means _au fait_ with the technicalities, but it is good to see that people who are, are not afraid to call their bosses to task.

* And then there’s the Korean TV network that got slammed by viewers and, worse, advertisers, for broadcasting the story of famed stem-cell researcher [Hwang Woo Suk’s little ethical problem] ~~http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2005-11-27T090111Z_01_FOR731850_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-KOREA-SCIENCE-DC.XML&archived=False~~. Fine, fine people, those patriots.[^1]

And how nice that the BBC news story about how [science teachers are scared of teaching experiments](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4470148.stm) -- for all the wrong reasons -- features a photo of  -- GASP! -- students not wearing protective goggles.
