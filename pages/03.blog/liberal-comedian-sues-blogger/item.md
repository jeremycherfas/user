A fine, fine episode from “They Just Don’t Get It”.

Garrison Keillor [sues](http://www.mnspeak.com/mnspeak/archive/post-733.cfm) Rex Sorgatz. What an idiot!

The comments are just great.


! 2021-09-14 Quick update: I was wrong to say “sues”. At least, I can find no trace of the cease-and-desist letter leading to any kind of court action.
