I decided to give up on the Simplr theme and throw my lot in with Sandbox and its devotees, in particular a theme called Shades of Gray. It seems to do just about everything I want, which could be described as simple complexity. Or complex simplicity.[^fn1] Either way, I quite like it the way it is, especially the fact that there is one sidebar down the right-hand side and another one (where the photos are) across the bottom. That’s very clever. My only tweak so far is to unbold the links and slightly change their colour. There’s a little more I’d like to do in that direction, just as I’d also like to come up with a better image across the top. The whole Judgements thing is broken too. But all that can wait. So, how do you like it?

[^fn1]: This is crap, I know.
