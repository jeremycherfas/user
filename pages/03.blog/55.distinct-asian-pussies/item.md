Those spambots never sleep. My colleague in arms Luigi wrote a very nice blog post over at the other place about the genetic patterns among domestic cats the world over. Naturally he entitled it "[Pussy galore](http://agro.biodiver.se/2008/02/pussy-galore/)". Just for a laugh, you understand. But I don't think either of us was fully prepared for the spamstorm that ensued. At least 50 comments which, it has to be said, [Askimet](http://akismet.com/) stopped in their tracks. But we got to thinking, could things have been worse. Buried in the details of the scientific study is the nugget that the cats of Asia are most distinct from all the other geographical groups of cats. The inference, as Luigi explains it, is that "cats went to Asia early, and became relatively isolated there, from the rest of the world and from each other". Hence the headline of this post. Let the spamwinds blow.
