A really nice story in [Smithsonian](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/back-home-on-the-range-85961623/), about the return of bison to the prairies. There isn't a whole lot of new stuff there, but it is good to see it all brought together, and especially to see how the linkages among the various plant and animal species contribute to the system as a whole. This is not mystical Gaia-type ramblings. It is just another testament to the value of biodiversity. And this:

> Bison often gather around prairie dog towns. "Since the dogs constantly clip off grasses, there's always new growth, and it's very nutritious for the bison," Murray explains. Young bison grow faster when they graze in prairie dog towns.

sounds suspiciously like a case for agricultural biodiversity.

Thanks Luigi for the link.
