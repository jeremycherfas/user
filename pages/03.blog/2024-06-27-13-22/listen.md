Episode summary: Intelligence scholar Hugh Wilford&rsquo;s excellent new book grapples with the paradox at the heart of America&rsquo;s covert intelligence agency. Many of the CIA&rsquo;s founding fathers were staunch anti-imperialists, but during the Cold War, the US took up the mantle of Europe&rsquo;s colonial projects.Hugh Wilford&rsquo;s book The CIA: an Imperial History is out now. Hugh Wilford has written numerous books about the CIA and Cold War intelligence history, he made two appearances in our recent Not All Propaganda is Art mini-series. Also the mini-series got a really nice write up in the New Yorker last month!
