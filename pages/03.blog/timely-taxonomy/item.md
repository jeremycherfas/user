In the TLS, [a review](https://web.archive.org/web/20060930001440/http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25343-2098204_1,00.html) of a new translation of Linneaus' _Philosophica Botanica_, another book that I am sure to know more about through reviews than reading. No matter, the point is that this review, by [Jim Endersby](http://www.jimendersby.com/), a Cambridge historian of science, is as good an introduction to the delights and difficulties of classification and taxonomy and their relation to evolution as one could want. I’ll let pass his sly dig at free trade -- “myth” indeed -- and commend it to one and all.
