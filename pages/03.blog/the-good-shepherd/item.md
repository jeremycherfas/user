When a long time passes quickly, that’s a good sign. When you leave a movie thinking, “I wonder what that meant?”. Suspense without phony fear. Definitely a fine movie. Matt Damon is wonderfully repressed throughout, the only distraction being that I was continually reminded of an old and dear friend, the resemblance almost uncanny. There’s not a lot wrong with [The Good Shepherd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/), except that Angelina Jolie does absolutely nothing for me, in this or anything else. But that’s a minor consideration.

[Rating:4.5/5]
