I'm getting really sick of websites that make me sign in with one of my other accounts in order to leave a comment. Especially when, as with this latest attempt on Typepad they can't seem to do it right. So maybe I can use that as an opportunity to do more here. [^fn1]

This cheffy bloke, Jeremy Shapiro, [recently wrote][1] about making his own _grano arso_ by toasting some durum flour "to a nutty brown colour" and then baking a fairly rustic loaf with it. Which, of course, reminded me of my own experiments along these lines, [back in 2011][2]. And then I realized that although I [got the flour][3], and baked a couple of loaves with it, I never actually wrote it up. Or, if I did, I can't find it. My brain is like that these days.

As I recall it was really rather good. Maybe I left myself some notes.

[^fn1]: Whether the target of my comment will ever see this and reply is anybody's guess
