Blog carnivals are a good way of finding interesting items and blogs worth revisiting. The flip side of that is that they can be a good way of attracting new readers. Too often I forget about the first point while focussed on the first. So here’s a tribute to [Berry-go-round](https://foothillsfancies.blogspot.com/2008/04/spring-at-berry-go-round-4.html), which I hope brought us some readers over at [the other place](https://agro.biodiver.se/).

seedsaside has some fascinating stuff. [Flowers](https://seedsaside.wordpress.com/2008/03/28/a-flower-bath/) with a calyx that holds water are much less likely to be parasitized by a moth that destroys their sexual structures. Good reason to take a bath, no? There's also a little [seed identity parade](https://seedsaside.wordpress.com/2008/04/18/seeds-aside/), but don't read the comments if you want to play.

And at [The Beagle Project blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20130312131812/http://blog.hmsbeagleproject.org/2008/04/new-in-new-york-darwins-garden.html), mention of an exhibit at the New York Botanical Garden of Darwin's Garden. It’s supposed to be a recreation of the garden at Down House, although the blog entry waxes more lyrical about the notebooks on display than about the garden. Does it include the [Sandwalk](https://web.archive.org/web/20090909130904/http://www.englishheritageprints.com/pictures_553008/down-house-sandwalk-k000185.html)? And how about the [boulder](http://www.webmesh.co.uk/darwinworms3.htm) being buried by earthworms?
