![xkcd cartoon about how to handle a crush](friends.png){.center}

Some things never change. I remember going through almost [exactly this line of reasoning](https://xkcd.com/513/) not once but twice, for different girls, about 40 years ago. In neither case did things work out the way I wanted. In one, things worked out very much the way she wanted, which was and is great. In the other ... who knows. But Google is my friend.
