Blog headlines (and posts) I wish I had written:

> Participation of the poor in mainstreaming gender empowerment for civil society stakeholders to promote country ownership of good governance for community-driven sustainable development[^1]

Seminar bingo is, of course, nothing new; we played it when I were a lad, and I’m sure so did the perfessers when they were lads. But this is something entirely new (to me). William Easterly, no friend of aid, gets stuck in to the fuzziness. I won’t extract my favorite bits. I’ll urge you to read the whole thing.

[^1]: 2022-02-24: Of course, I now wish I had not extrqacted by copied the whole thing, because the link where it used to be http://blogs.nyu.edu/fas/dri/aidwatch/2009/02/participation_of_the_poor_in_m.html is dead and I can find no trace of it anywhere, not even on [William Easterly's site](https://www.williameasterly.org/), where Search does absolutely nothing.
