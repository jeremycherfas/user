Episode summary: October 1945 and the trial starts in less than a month &ndash; but do the Russians genuinely want it to happen? They seem to be employing delaying tactics &ndash; is it because they can also be accused of war crimes? Or is it just another regular SNAFU? Each day brings a new problem: first, to find enough German lawyers to represent the 22 defendants (but access to American PX supplies closes the deal for most of them)&hellip;can Russia provide translations of its documents (Stalin had executed most people in Russia who could speak a foreign language)?&hellip;the rivalry between the judges (Biddle expected to be appointed President of the Court, but Truman conceded it should be the British judge)&hellip;and yet, somehow, they manage to start on time. Starring Nicholas Woodeson as Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, the President of the Court and Nathan Wiley as Judge Parker. Major Airey Neave - FREDDIE FOX Peggy - ROSIE SHEEHY Robert H Jackson - JOSEPH MYDELL Sir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON Iona&hellip;
