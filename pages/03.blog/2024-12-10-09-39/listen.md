Episode summary: When World War Two came to Greece, a period of terrible human suffering followed. There was a brutal battle with Italian and then Nazi forces, followed by an occupation in which thousands were executed and a terrible famine swept the nation. There&rsquo;s an often repeated number that appears to capture the brutality of this time &ndash; that 10% of the Greek population died during the war. We investigate where this statistic comes from and whether it is true.
