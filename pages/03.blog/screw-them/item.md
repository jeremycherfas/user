The flood of comment spam was getting really bad, so for a while back there I [turned off commenting](http://jeremycherfas.net/blog/screw-this/). But it made no difference. I didn’t really understand what was going on, although I’ve been reading a bit about [splogs](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/14/Splogs), which as ever are mucking things up for everyone. But I still don’t really get it. No matter. Understanding would be a bonus. The crucial thing is to deal spam-sucking death to the ichor dripping fiends. So I installed two of the three recommended WordPress weapons: [Bad Behavior](https://web.archive.org/web/20051130095431/http://www.ioerror.us/software/bad-behavior/) and [Spam Karma 2](https://unknowngenius.com/blog/archives/2005/05/10/spam-karma-2-wordpress-151/). The third, referrer Karma, scared me off with its need to edit my core WP pages. I’ll bite that particular bullet if things don’t improve.

For now, friends, would you do me a favour? Leave a comment, so I can see how these things perform. Thanks!
