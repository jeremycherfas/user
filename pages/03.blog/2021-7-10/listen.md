Episode summary: This episode picks up where Episode 167 left off. We suggest you listen to them in order. When Aaron Quinn called the Vallejo police to report that his girlfriend Denise Huskins had been kidnapped, and went into the station for questioning, a detective told Aaron that he didn’t believe him. When Denise was released after being held captive for about 48 hours, police didn’t believe her either. It soon became clear that the police viewed Denise and Aaron as suspects, not victims. Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn’s book is Victim F. For a transcript of this episode, send an email to transcripts@thisiscriminal.com with the episode name and number.
