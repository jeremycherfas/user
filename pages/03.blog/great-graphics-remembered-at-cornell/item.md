[Rebecca](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2006/10/visualizing_meaning_project_co.html) has turned up another great find: [Visualizing Meaning](https://web.archive.org/web/20170719024829/http://martha.mannlib.cornell.edu/charts/) at Cornell University. The entire faculty was asked: “Of the many charts (graph, map, diagram, table and other) you have seen in your life, which has been the most important, remarkable, meaningful or valuable”. The results are wonderful browse-fodder.

Most remarkably of all, the Visualizing Meaning site appears to be powered by WordPress. How’d they do that?

! 2021-10-16: I no longer care how they made the site in WordPress. I’m much more concerned about what has become of it.
