<p class="highlight">When I thought of myself as a public radio producer, I never had any interest in creating a show or being a host. I just thought, “That’s what somebody else does. That’s not a strength of mine.” So when we created the CDS podcast, I thought we were going to make pieces and since I’m the only person here I guess I’m the host; I’ll go on and say something to introduce the piece. But it’s interesting then with something like Seeing White, where I actually found I really enjoyed figuring out how to frame these pieces and establishing a certain kind of tone and relationship to the audience. And so I’ve embraced that role of the podcast host.</p>

<p class="highlight">One thing I’ve learned is that quality and focus, giving people an experience, a journey they can go on that goes deeper into one set of ideas, has become much more attractive.</p>
