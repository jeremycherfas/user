**Tuesday 5 September:** I just knew this was going to get boring, and it has. There was the six and a half hour walk on Sunday, fuelled only by a single small cheese sandwich and a few grapes. I’m sure I would have been ravenous pre-SLD. And I had to tighten my watch strap. My watch-strap, for God’s sake, and I’ve never thought of myself as having fat (or even muscular, _pace_ Bobby Orr) wrists. Other than that, things are just fine.
