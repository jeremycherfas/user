Er, would you mind signing this bit of paper here please? I’d hate anyone to think I was taking advantage of you.

> The aim of the campaign is really to stop young men taking advantage of drunken women and having sex with them  [Danny Shaw BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4780992.stm)

That Shaw boy surely has a way with words. Which reminds me of a quote I made a note of:

> Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. _C.S. Lewis_.

So girls, if you don’t want to have sex with appalling men who would take advantage of a legless drunk -- remembering that most men will fuck mud -- my advice is: don’t become a legless drunk.
