Many of the more upmarket bars do a little free-for-the-taking spread of an evening, lest one drink without something to nibble. I was hungrier than that. But it was late in the day, and the selection of sandwiches was not great. I lit on one of -- surprise -- mozarella, prosciutto and tomato, and ordered it with my drink.

"But please do not reheat it for me." I'm not trying to be difficult here. I just don't like each and every sandwich being squished and heated. I like my mozarella unmelted and chewy. And I am not mad keen on hot tomatoes or warm prosciutto.

"Just a little," counters the waitress. "_Poco, poco._" We argue good naturedly for a bit until, sensitive as ever, I detect that I am not going to be allowed to have a cold sandwich. "OK" I concede. "_Ma poco poco_."

The sandwich comes, and the top and bottom are both lightly carbonized. It is burned, in parts. The mozarella squirts everywhere and the tomato scalds my tongue. "_Poco poco_," she says, a teeny bit triumphant sounding to me.

I'm not about to send it back though, so I eat it, and it is good enough, even though not exactly what I wanted. And every time the waitress passes the table she tells me, she doesn't ask: "it is better reheated." I need to be told.

*p.s. This was not Rome, Rome, but how am I to build up a series of amusing vignettes if I pay strict attention to irrelevant details?*
