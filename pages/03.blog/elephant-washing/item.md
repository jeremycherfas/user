I’m actually just testing this to see how blogging from Flickr works. It would save masses of time and effort (both of which are in short supply) to be able to do this kind of thing.

Later ... Odd. Flickr said that I had failed. But I had not. Looks ghastly, of course, but that’s easy to fix. Must check this out. But not now.

!!! 2022-02-27: Leaving this as is (rather than repatriating the photo) for the record. Those were the days, eh, jumpring through hoops to share an image first to Flickr and then [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) it back to my website, before I had any idea what PESOS was. Or were?
