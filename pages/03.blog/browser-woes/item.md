Two readers (a triumph in itself) have informed me that my site now looks terrible on their browsers. One even sent a screenshot, which suggests that the browser is not seeing the stylesheet. The trouble is, on my PC (at work) the site looks just fine in Explorer. So I am at a loss. I know I haven’t touched the stylesheet in months. And I can’t investigate the problem, being still without internet at home. Could it be that one of the endless updates has messed Explorer further?

All I can suggest is that you switch to a [proper browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/). You won’t regret it.
