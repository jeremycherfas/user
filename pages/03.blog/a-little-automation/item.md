Quite apart from the fact that I have barely written a thing here for almost a month, I thought it would be worthwhile to pick a low-hanging fruit. So I followed the very simple instructions at [Automate your outgoing webmentions](https://webmention.app/) and now my hope is that I have removed one more piece of grit from what I laughingly call my workflow. It won't make me write more often, but when I do manage it will be one less thing to concern myself with.
