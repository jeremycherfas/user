Er ... fimoculous made me link to this ~~[T](http://www.cultureshiftclothing.com/mens/CUL062.html)~~.

And whatâ€™s that fine movie about guys on a river rafting trip threatened by gun-toting lunatics? Meryl Streep, I think, was in it. Anyway, I want to see the God-botherers and the Darwinists load buckshot for their rides down the [Grand Canyon](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/06/science/sciencespecial2/seeing-creation-and-evolution-in-grand-canyon.html). We Pastafarians will inherit the earth. (Thanks Rebecca.)
