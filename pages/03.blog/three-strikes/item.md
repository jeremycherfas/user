[fimoculous](http://www.fimoculous.com/) has three absolute gems this morning, to whit:

* [Sexually active popes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_sexually_active_popes).
* [Radio David Byrne](http://davidbyrne.com/radio/index.php).
* [Things that make no sense](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/space/mg18524911.600).

Somehow I can't quite bring myself to work Stop Making Sense into this post.

*24 March 2018:* I wonder if those are still there. I didn't save the permalink, which seems an oversight.
