Episode summary: This month, we’re taking some time to appreciate our furry — or scaly, or… slimy — friends, the animals that we bring into our homes. Spoiler alert: some great pet names in here. In this episode, you’ll hear: Manoush Zomorodi, Jen Poyant, Nikki Silva, Roman Mars, Neil Katcher, Dave Nadelberg, Jonathan Mitchell, Phoebe Judge, Lauren Spohrer, Joe Richman, Nate DiMeo, Helen Zaltzman and Ian Chillag. We want to see your pets! Share your furry friends in the Radiotopia Citizens Facebook Group. And finally, we want to remind you all that we have Radiotopia merch for sale! Grab a T-shirt, camping mug, water bottle or a perfect beach tote.
