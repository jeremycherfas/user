##OMFG! It worked
###It really did (if this appears)
####One final reality check; in the right directory

It has been a fun couple of weeks as I have gently come to grips with this new CMS, [Grav](http://getgrav.org/). It is actually way more powerful than I need, but I rather like the way it works, at least as far as I understand it, and I have been able to bend it slightly to my will. The result is what you see here.

There are still things I want to fix; there always are. Like, why is the font in this second paragraph always larger? I ought to have something useful in the footer, for example, and maybe even a custom favicon. Social connections are essential, I suppose. But that can wait, as can getting all the older posts in. 

I really love digging into things like this, finding out more or less how things work, tweaking them, getting to an end state that I like. But I also want to get this out there and live, not least so that I have somewhere to send stuff.

So the next stage is going to be a little complicated. There's an excellent tutorial from Grav, which I hope to emerge from unscathed. If you're reading this, it means I succeeded.
