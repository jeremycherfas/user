I've been absent from here for over a month, but with very good reason. Work took me to Indonesia, for the first time, and a wonderfully interesting trip it was too. I can't say more than that, or post any photos, at least for now, but it did result in a rambling soliloquy about Indonesian food over at [Eat This Podcast](http://www.eatthispodcast.com/crackers-about-indonesian-food/) and a slightly more detailed [post about one of the multitude of crackers](http://www.eatthispodcast.com/all-about-that-indonesian-cracker/) in which Indonesia seems to specialise.

And speaking of Eat This Podcast, I was absolutely thrilled and delighted to be nominated again for a James Beard Foundation Award. Maybe this time ...

That will do for now.
