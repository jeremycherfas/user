Neat! The Human Flower  Project [reports](https://web.archive.org/web/20060529030623/http://www.humanflowerproject.com/index.php/weblog/pacific_begonias_pick_em_while_theyre_hot/) on the Capitola California Begonia Festival, making the delicious point that bulb growers aren't really interested in the flowers, at least commercially. So the Festival is a classic example of recycling rubbish.

! 2021-09-08: There’s a sad coda to this story. The festival [ended after 65 years](https://www.begoniafestival.com/) in 2017 because the Brown family, which had donated the flowers that made the festival possible, decided that it was “no longer … profitable to grow flower bulbs in California”. I feel sure there is a complex story of global trade in there somewhere. However, all is not lost. In a couple of weeks it will be time to celebrate the [Capitola Beach Festival](http://capitolabeachfestival.com/) “planning all the same events that have been held in past years”.
