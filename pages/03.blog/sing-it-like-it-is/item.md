Over at [The Viscount LaCarte](http://viscountlacarte.blogspot.com/2008/01/whos-gonna-build-your-wall.html)'s place, I find a video of a guy I didn’t know -- Tom Russell -- singing a song I didn’t know -- Who’s gonna build your wall? No surprise in the fact that I didn’t know either. The surprises are that it seems to have escaped the vast mass of drawbridge-lifters that they depend utterly on immigrants, illegal and otherwise, and that the song itself does not seem to have all that much impact. At least not as far as I can tell.

Anyway, there it is.
