This past couple of weeks I sipped from the well of erudition. [Professor Leonard Barkan](http://www.princeton.edu/complit/people/display_person.xml?netid=lbarkan&display=All), of Princeton University, gave the [2011 Jerome Lectures at the American Academy in Rome](http://sofaarome.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/the-2011-jerome-lectures-princeton%E2%80%99s-leonard-barkan-raar%E2%80%9910-on-food-culture-and-high-culture-antiquity-and-renaissance/), and his topic was _Unswept floor: food culture and high culture, antiquity and renaissance_.

===

At this point, having been to all of Professor Barkan's lectures, any sly comments I might make about parts being hard to digest, or tasty, or nauseating, [^fn1] or anything else in the comestible line, would be entirely superfluous. His knowledge flowed wide and deep and covered the broadest of fields, such that I was both fully prepared for Language Log's recent discussion of a [wee spat between Bertrand Russell and Roman Jakobson](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3023), and ready to discuss, briefly, with friends the significance of invitations to dinner in Roman satire. (Lord Macaulay's _aper√ßu_ -- that most dinner parties are given by way of revenge -- did not get a mention.)

What lasting impression did I come away with? That this scene has an extremely long and extremely interesting history, and is by no means merely funny.

[^fn1]: I wouldn't choose to display my ignorance of high culture just for a cheap laugh.
