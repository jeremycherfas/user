[The Countess](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496634/) arrived more or less unheralded in our house, and on a quiet evening after a hard day, her appeal was great. I mean, “She sacrificed all for love... and sacrificed others for beauty. A 17th century Hungarian countess embarks on a murderous undertaking, with the belief that bathing in the blood of virgins will preserve her beauty.” What’s not to like about that? The Countess is a nice Gothic romp, lovely costumes, menacing castles, secret passages, just enough S&M to keep things interesting and, of course, bleedin’ virgins. Nice philosophical questions too, to be asked with a sadistic glint in the eye, natch. Like, is a woman who has shared herself only with other women still a virgin? Of course it bears no relation to the true story ([whatever that might be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzebet_Bathory)) or to the many other versions of the same story. But it did pass the time pleasantly enough.
