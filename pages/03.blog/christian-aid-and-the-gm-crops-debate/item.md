I’m not a Christian, but [Christian Aid and the GM crops debate](https://web.archive.org/web/20041217014246/http://www.christianaid.org.uk/indepth/412gmfood/index.htm) seems a pretty thoughtful piece. In particular, it draws attention to the way in which the idea that “GM can solve the problems of world hunger” consumes all the oxygen that could feed other flames.
