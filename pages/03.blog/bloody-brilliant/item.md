Another great sciencish headline:

> [Will Corn Help Cure AIDS?](https://www.science20.com/news_releases/will_corn_help_cure_aids)

No, but it’ll probably speed the evolution of resistance.

Strategy: one, engineer HIV antibodies into maize; two, feed maize to people; three, halt transmission of HIV. Which is where the reasoning stops. Step four, I would suggest, might be, evolve new epitope that is not blocked by engineered antibody. Five; continue merrily on one’s way.
