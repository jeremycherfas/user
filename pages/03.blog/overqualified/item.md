Added some new letters to my name: FCD. That’s [Friends of Charles Darwin](http://darwin.gruts.com/). Not sure what good this will do me, but I’m proud to say it loud: I’m godless and proud. And it sits well alongside my ministry in the [Universal Life Church](http://www.ulc.org/). I bought that back in the Silurian, having taken umbrage at idiots who had somehow obtained a PhD in biochemistry and who thought that qualified them as palaeontologists. If Duane was going to wave his PhD at me, I thought, I’ll wave my Rev. right back at him and his hordes. And I did, in a couple of pieces and a few debates. There was an organisation called APE, the Association for the Protection of Evolution (Heavens to Betsy, [~~google~~ The Internet Archive is great](https://web.archive.org/web/20060812001555/http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=26600)) that set out to hound the UK’s creationists, and I occasionally lent a hand. But I gave it up as not worth the candle.

I haven’t seen my sustificate of reverendship in a while -- very tasteful it was too -- but in my heart. although, alas, not on the website of the ULC, I know  my name is writ in the good book: The Rev. Jeremy Cherfas, PhD, FCD, ETC. Read it and giggle.
