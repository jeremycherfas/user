There's a clear metaphor at the heart of [Wasabi](https://imdb.com/title/tt0281364/): Jean Reno sucks great gobbets of the aforementioned cruciferous paste from his fingertips and evinces no emotion, no stimulation, whatsoever. He's **that** hard. Or, alternatively, this wasabi is entirely without heat. Take your pick. One thing’s for certain. [Léon](https://imdb.com/title/tt0110413/), it ain’t. 

My rating: 1 out of 5
