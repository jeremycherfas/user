Episode summary: Scholar and artist Kate Crawford joins the podcast to talk about why we donâ€™t just need to imagine how to fix the internet, but how we want to change society. Kate is a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at NYU and author of the Atlas of AI, coming April 2021 on Yale University Press. She walks us through the extractive nature of AI, talks about her collaborations with Vladan Joler (recently acquired by MoMA) and Trevor Paglan, and a fascinating history of classification.
