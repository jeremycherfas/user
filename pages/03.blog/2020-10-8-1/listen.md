Episode summary: This episode of The Memory Palace was commissioned by the KeyBank Rochester Fringe Festival and the New York State Council of the Arts in 2019. It’s ideally meant to be listened to at the corner of Corinthian and State downtown. But, you’ll likely enjoy it wherever you are. The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, from PRX.
