Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.?  This week: 87.0

**Tuesday 2 October:** Got back last Saturday morning after an overnight flight and hopped on the scales, just for fun. 89.4. Not so good, but maybe better than it could have been. Appetite suppression stayed good. The problem was twofold; boredom, and delicious food. I know I ate some food simply for want of anything better to do. And East African curries are just so delicious that on a couple of occasions I managed to eat far more than I needed to. Still, all is not lost. Or rather (heehee) it is. Back down this morning to a new all-time low.
