![The impossibly glamorous Marie Lavoisier](Portrait_of_Monsieur_Lavoisier_and_His_Wife_small.jpg){.left}

I was momentarily distracted while listening to [Lord Bragg](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/iot) on Women in Enlightment Science trying to recall whether I had ever seen the famed double-portrait of the Lavoisiers. So as soon as I got to the desktop I went looking, and I don't believe I had. My original intention had been to just nick the image, but the blog I found it on is interesting enough to merit credit. Thanks.
