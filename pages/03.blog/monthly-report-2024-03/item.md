March was ... March. Changeable, erratic, unpredictable. Good things on the bicycle, taking the train somewhere and cycling to a different train station. Movement among the plants on the terrace. Good fun and some entertaining podcasts made.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- Home-made lemon curd from home-grown lemons
- Getting closer to photos all processed
- Dinners cooked for friends
- Macro to make work notes easier
- Signed up for Komoot to guide bicycle rides
- Which prompted a program to draw a static map with photo markers
- Celebratory Guinness for St Patrick's
- Repotting continues
- Judicious POSSE to Mastodon

### Activities

Steps down a little and HIIT too, because cycling. Less time in bed and asleep as the days grow longer. Weight bad, which I put down to eating out on Tuesdays. (I weigh on Wednesdays)

### Stuff Done

Hard to put my finger on anything super-specific. Even so, it felt like a good month, overall. I missed out on the IndieWeb Carnival this month, probably because I do not have much to say on [accessibility in the small web](https://blog.basementcommunity.com/indieweb-carnival-march-round-up/) and my site is by no means an exemplar of good practice. Might be the first month in which hours logged to podcasting exceeded hours logged to administration.

#### Hours logged per month

### Goals

Nine posts this month, which is encouraging.

### Niggles

Yet more bicycle rides needed.

### Final remarks

Going into some serious travelling, and trying to be positive about keeping things buzzing online. But maybe not.
