Sometimes the zeitgeist is trying to tell you something. Like when [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/01/06/144806987/the-friday-podcast-who-killed-lard) and [BBC Radio 4's Food Programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01npb10) tackle the same subject in utterly different ways and yet come to an almost similar conclusion: lard; a bit of what you fancy does you good.

Of the two, I'd have to say that Planet Money was the more interesting for me. Maybe that's because I didn't know about the struggles of the chemical industry to perfect the product that become Crisco. Whereas I did know how to render pork fat down to make my own lard, and the sound of two blokes having a blokish time doing the same does not make for compelling radio. Same goes for chefs waxing lyrical, although the idea of having the story of Italian _lardo_ told by a vegetarian was, shall I say, ingenious. And full marks to both programmes for not succumbing to the very obvious Jello Biafra musical accompaniment.

I do hope I can get a _bruschetta al lardo_ where we're eating tonight. And what is happening to all that pig fat that we are no longer eating as lard? Must be ending up somewhere.
