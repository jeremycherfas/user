## The Weight

I had thought, when I started this series, that there would be at least one song in each of the Sounds to Grow On episodes that would be worth singling out; that hasn’t been the case. I’m not saying that there won’t be more Folkways tracks in future, only that nothing in the past couple of shows I listened to shook me by the scruff. Instead, here’s something that did.
