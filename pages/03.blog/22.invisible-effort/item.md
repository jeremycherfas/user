It would be easy enough to look at this website and conclude that I have been no more present here than I was on the old set-up. That would be wrong. For one thing, there have been quite a few tweaks under the hood that aren't visible but that do make a difference to what is visible. For another, there's the somewhat daunting task of bringing over the ±1400 posts from the old site and trying to make sure that links from the old site end up on the correct page here.

===

This last I finally accomplished this morning, thanking to one of my ever-helpful friends at [ADN](http://alpha.dot.net). And what prompted that was an ill-advised visit to Google Analytics, which showed that external links to several of my most popular posts were leading nowhere. So that's where I focussed my attention this week bringing over a dozen or so posts on everything from [Big Mike bananas](../a-taste-of-big-mike) to [Asian pussies](../distinct-asian-pussies).

Because it wouldn't do to let the Googlers down in their search for erudition.

The more difficult question is how -- or even whether -- to put these link-checked, spruced up blog entries out there. On balance, they're probably best ignored. Only ±1350 to go.
