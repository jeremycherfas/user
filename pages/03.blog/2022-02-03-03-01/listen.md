Episode summary: Michael Lewis published his first book, Liar&rsquo;s Poker, in 1989. It&rsquo;s about his time as a bond salesman on Wall Street &mdash; and it was a runaway best seller. Pushkin Industries is re-releasing it for the first time as an unabridged audiobook, read by the author. And to celebrate, Lewis has made a special mini-series about the book. Over the course of five weeks, he&rsquo;ll revisit people he worked with, explore how he found his voice as a writer, and ask why Wall Street firms still assign the book to their interns today. You can order Liar&rsquo;s Poker audiobook at Pushkin.fm/LiarsPoker. Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com
