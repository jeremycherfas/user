Michael C. LaBarbera at the University of Chicago has an archive of what must have been interesting lectures on [The Biology of B-Movie Monsters](https://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/).[^1] Maybe he's the person to illuminate [P.Z. Myers on Buffy's biology](https://web.archive.org/web/20081123023925/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/and_really_buffys_biology_is_w.php)?
