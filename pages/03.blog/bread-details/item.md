I doubt that anyone is using this blog to follow events in the world of no-knead bread, but just in case, there’s a [follow-up article](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/06mini.html?ref=dining) in yesterday’s New York Times. Lots of people have tried lots of experiments, and the article rounds up some of them. But it does not mention my greatest discovery, which is that the method works just as well with the wild yeasts in my sourdough as with domesticated yeast. I use the whole 225 grams of my sourdough (though I am sure it would work as well with less) and remove the starter for the next batch at the end of the second rise. Nothing to it.
