The Rome Digest is plugging a translation of [Popes, Peasants, and Shepherds: Recipes and Lore from Rome and Lazio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520271548/). Somewhat sensitised by my earlier efforts to [dispel the idea that the herb _mentuccia_ is pennyroyal](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/mentuccia-is-not-pennyroyal/), I looked inside. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the error continues to be perpetuated. I can’t find a way to comment at [The Rome Digest]~~http://theromedigest.com/~~,[^1] or the translator’s site, so this marker will have to do.

[^1]: 2022-04-04: Currently for sale at less than $3500, a snip.
