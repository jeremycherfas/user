Episode summary: Each sip of coffee we drink is steeped in dark colonial past. The reason we can enjoy it every morning is because it’s relatively cheap, and many people suffered under European colonisers to create systems that produced this cheap coffee. But unfortunately, that’s just the beginning. Colonialism has stripped enslaved and indigenous people of their language, pushed their descendants into work that a modern European would never do, and created racial ideologies that persist and harm people of colour to this day. In this bonus episode of A History of Coffee, documentary maker James Harper moderates a conversation between Professor Peter D’Sena, a leading historian from the decolonising academic movement, and Professor Jonathan Morris, author of Coffee: A Global History. They explore how colonialism shaped coffee, and what a cup of coffee that seeks to address the damage of colonialism would look like.
