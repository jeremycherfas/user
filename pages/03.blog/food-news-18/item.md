Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.5  This week: 87.3

**Tuesday 7 November:** Back on track again, with a minuscule drop over the week that is well within the margin of error of the scales but that is also entirely acceptable in the overall scheme of things. I seem to be regaining a bit of appetite, particularly as regards the occasional snack. A handful (small) of hazelnets when I get back from work, a couple of squares of chocolate after supper, that kind of thing. This may be a sign, according to one who has been there, that I am [drifting to a stop](http://ethesis.blogspot.com/2006/11/shangri-la-diet-maintenance.html) near my set point. But actually, Iâ€™d like to get a little lower, to give myself some room to fluctuate. That may take more drastic measures than simply drinking the oil. But first I want to settle down again from all the recent travel.
