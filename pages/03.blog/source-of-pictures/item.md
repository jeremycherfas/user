On this day in 2009 I wrote this:

> [Life.com](https://www.life.com/) has put a huge number of images online. The trick is to use the date slider to refine your search.There are two ways to share the images. One, to embed, as above. The other, to link directly, as below, but that seems not to work so well. I'm testing it here to see what happens to sizing.

Today, that open access has been handed over to Google and various other [agents for Life](https://www.life.com/life-picture-collection/).

I could not find a way actually to use an image in this blog post without, you know, simply stealing the image, like this:

I can legitimately [share a link](https://artsandculture.google.com/favorite/group/2AJyLBDjHYbNJg), but that's hardly the same thing.

Sorry Life, you lose on this one.
