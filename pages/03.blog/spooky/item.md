On Saturday night, I finished reading David Denby’s article in the latest New Yorker, on the transformation of cinema viewing, and fell asleep. On Sunday night, with supper, I picked up where I left off, with a newly published Primo Levi story called [Bear Meat](https://web.archive.org/web/20070105044623/http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/content/articles/070108fi_fiction). Spooky to the max, as we used to say. Why? That’ll have to wait until I write up what happened between waking up on Sunday morning and resuming my New Yorker reading.
