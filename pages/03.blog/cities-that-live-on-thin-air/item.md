Melvyn Bragg’s [In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/in-our-time/) had a pair of episodes on the history of cities that were packed with fascinating ideas, any one of which could probably have spun off into a programme of its own. And of course I shouldn’t criticise for what wasn't there. But really, to spend 80 minutes discussing the history of cities without once mentioning food and how you get it from where it is produced to where it is consumed, seemed a bit of an oversight. Rather than complain at length, however, I’ll just suggest that anyone who feels the same way I do could do worse than watch Carolyn Steel’s [^fn1] Tedtalk [How food shapes our cities](https://www.ted.com/speakers/carolyn_steel). You too, Lord Bragg.

[^fn1]: She was on [The Food Programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/foodprogramme_20080720.shtml) too, back in 2008.
