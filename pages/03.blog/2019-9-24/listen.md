Episode summary: George explores the roles of family and formal education in the lives of marginalised young people. With more elaborate scene-setting, his lyrical stream of consciousness flows over a soundscape that is increasingly cinematic and journalistic. The Poet argues that inner city music acts as a pressure valve for voiceless young people who face systemic disadvantage. Expanding on the points of the previous episode, he advocates for youth having space to “speak their truth”, and for listeners to take consideration of the problematic realities behind this art. Featured songs: Klashnekoff - Murder More Fire Crew - Oi So Solid - 21 Seconds Written by George the Poet Original score by Benbrick Produced by Benbrick and George The Poet #HYHGP For information regarding your data privacy, visit acast.com/privacy
