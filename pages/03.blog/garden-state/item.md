I can’t remember who recommended [Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/) -- probably Luigi -- but I know that I have been waiting forever for it to arrive. And, boy, was it worth it. It builds slowly, wonderfully, and to me brought to mind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in the almost imperceptible transformation in the lead characters. Natalie Portman was, well, Natalie Portman, and Zach Braff makes me wish I had seen Scrubs. OK, so I didn’t quite grasp the whole schtick about the gift at the end, but it didn’t much matter. Perfect for an afternoon when all was not quite right with the real world. 

My rating: 4.5 out of 5
