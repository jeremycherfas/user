Last night’s storm could have woken the dead. We risked going out because it had been a while since the previous excursion, and walked the streets with lightning fizzing all around and thunder above our heads. Dry lightning, I was hoping. But no, and when the rain and hail came they came solid enough to drench my head and lower legs in minutes. This morning I went out to survey the damage on the terrace, but there was none. Just two tiny wisteria seedlings and one set of tomato cotyledons, and if I were superstitious I’d say the storm did it.
