Eric Meyer reveals his “[Sooper-Dooper No-Patent-Pending DIY Anti-Jet-Lag Technique](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/01/29/how-to-avoid-jet-lag/)”. Not a lot to it; arrange matters so that you get your customary amount of sleep and wake at the time you would normally wake **shifted to your destination's time zone**. But Eric refuses to use melatonin. Why, I wonder. He says because it doesn’t work for him, and that’s fair enough. But I find that a version of Eric’s technique plus 3 mg of melatonin about half an hour before I want to sleep works better for me.

Of course, I can’t prove it is the melatonin. All I know is that I get a better night’s sleep, especially flying east, when I have swallowed one. What I really need, of course, is for someone secretly to replace my stash with placebo pills. But actually, I don’t. Because I don't care whether it really is the melatonin that helps me nod off, just as long as I continue to believe it is.
