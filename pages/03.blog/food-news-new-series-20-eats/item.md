Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.5 This week: 89.3

_New(ish) year, new approach. No more attempting to number by week, and no more beating myself over the head if I miss a week._

[The Art of Eating](https://www.artofeating.com/) is my unmissable periodical, the most intelligent, informative, well-written publication on food available anywhere. It looks good too. I’ve been a subscriber almost forever, have never even been tempted to let my subscription lapse. Wouldn’t it be nice to give something back, I thought.

Here it is: a Google map of all the establishments listed in the round up of _néo-bistros_ in Paris by Bénédict Beaugé and Edward Behr in issue 82, the latest to reach me. Ten establishments, a solid week’s eats.
