Episode summary: What happens when one people’s traditional food is also an international controlled substance? Turkish architect and food researcher Aylin Öney Tan goes on a deep dive into the history of opium poppy cultivation for food in Anatolia and the subsequent decades of international political interference in Turkey’s agricultural production. “The] opium poppy has always been a source of food for Anatolian people. You have to grow your own food and you have to be self sustained, that’s it!” Ox Tales is produced by Anna Sigrithur, edited by Naomi Duguid and Fiona Sinclair and mixed by Thomas Krause. Music in this episode was by Thomas Krause, Ava Glendinning, Uuriter, and Sara Afonso.
