Episode summary: In the early 1970s, Marty Goddard was worried about the high rates of sexual assault in Chicago. She learned from police that evidence from sexual assault cases often wasn&rsquo;t collected properly &mdash; or at all. &ldquo;They said, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t get evidence.&rsquo; And this really kicked everything off.&rdquo; Criminal is going back on tour in February!
