Episode summary: We asked you to tell us stories of meals you remember your grandmothers making. Now Sheila Dillon asks why these dishes - whether delicious or otherwise - stick with us into adulthood. Food writer Alissa Timoshkina shares her Grandparents Siberian recipes which provide the essence for her book ‘Salt & Time: Recipes from a Russian Kitchen’. Blogger Ann Storr reminisces about her grannie’s high standards at the table. And we hear from people trying to preserve age old recipes, before they disappear for good. Presented by Sheila Dillon Produced in Bristol by Clare Salisbury
