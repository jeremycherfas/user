Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.3  This week: 87.7  
**Tuesday 14 November:** Oh, the exquisite irony of it. I spend the weekend picking olives but I have no rice oil with me. And of course I overcompensated like mad for all that exercise. But a bruschetta with fresh, green oil is the exact opposite of 15ml of rice oil: tasty in the extreme. I seem to have been on a bit of a plateau for a while now, and I am also conscious that my appetite for a nibble of chocolate or a handful of nuts has returned, at least to some extent. On Monday I somewhat guiltily polished off a 100 gm bag of cashew nuts because I happened to go to the supermarket to get some stuff before supper, and I was a bit peckish. Boy did I feel full after that. A couple of months ago I wouldn’t have been peckish and I wouldn’t have bought the nuts. This could be a sign that I am nearing my set-point weight, but I’d actually like to be a bit lighter. So I’ll either have to be a bit more disciplined about the snacking, finishing helpings and so on, or else adopt one of the “bonus points” methods, though I don’t particularly fancy drinking a tasteless smoothie while wearing nose-clips.
