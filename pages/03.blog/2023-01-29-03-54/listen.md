Episode summary: Two very different tales about making stuff up about the CIA. Your host shares the story of Sylvia Press, who in the 1950s, wrote a revenge novel after she was fired during the McCarthy purges. And author Jefferson Morley tells us about the time CIA director Richard Helms tried to create an American James Bond with the help of future Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt. Get Jefferson Morley&rsquo;s amazing new book: Scorpion&rsquo;s Dance. Sylvia Press&rsquo;s novel The Care of Devils is harder to find.
