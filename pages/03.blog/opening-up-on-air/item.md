One of the best aspects of subscribing to things is that it doesn't matter if they go dormant. Someone takes a break from feeding their website/newsletter/podcast? No problem. When they return, your subscription springs back to life.[^1] So it was a special treat to see a new episode of Anxious Machine pop up in my podcast feed.

===

Special too because just a couple of days ago, in the process of rescuing things from an almost full notebook, I came across this entry from just over a year ago:

![Notebook page](anxious-machine.png?cropResize=650,){.center} 

Rob McGinley Myers had just published [a podcast outlining his rather wonderful ideas](http://www.anxiousmachine.com/podcast/2016/5/10/if-you-could-do-anything) for a new kind of published product, an audiobook whose chapters would be individual podcasts in a series. It struck me at the time as a genius idea, one that [I wish I had thought of](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/staff/cain/projects/huxley), and one that was worth making a note about.

I thought nothing more of it, except for occasionally coming across that note, because Rob had said very determinedly that the episode was the first in a three-part series, and obviously there was no point bothering him until he'd finished presenting the ideas. 

Which he never did, until last week, when my subscription to Anxious Machine sprang back to life.

Here -- a year later -- was [part two of the series](http://www.anxiousmachine.com/podcast/2017/5/24/electric-torture-device), an honest, sometimes raw, often funny account of the missing year And his problems. Listening, I could only imagine what he had gone through and what it took to make this episode. And I have no idea whether his idea is even still alive. That's not the point, really.[^2] The point is, Rob is podcasting again and I am glad he is, as it seems to be part of the solution. And while I am looking forward to part three, or whatever else comes next, I won't worry too much about when it will arrive, because when it does my subscription will spring back to life again.

[^1]: One reason why I very seldom delete subscriptions just because they're dormant. I may move them to a holding pen, but that's all. 

[^2]: If I weren't such a slacker I would have made my idea a reality without waiting on someone else.
