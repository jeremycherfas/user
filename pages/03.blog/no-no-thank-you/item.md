The opening title sequence was really wonderful. That’s not to denigrate the rest of the film, which was just the job for a slightly morose Monday evening. But the [book](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0812976525/136-8019806-0806706?SubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002) of [Thank You For Smoking](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9dGhhbmsgeW91IGZvciBzbW9raW5nfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_&fc=1&ft=20) is funnier and perhaps more interesting. Of course a film can’t often be as nuanced as a book, but freeze frames and voice-overs are somewhat lame. Finest line? “The great state of Vermont will not apologize for its cheese!” 

My rating: 4 out of 5
