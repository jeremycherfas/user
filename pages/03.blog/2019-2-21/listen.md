Episode summary: When Fannie Davis and her family moved to Detroit in the mid-1950s, they hadn’t prepared themselves for how hard it would be. They had trouble finding steady work. So, Fannie found a way to take care of her family. She started small, but built a robust and lucrative operation… a business that a lot of people knew about but no one talked about. Bridgett Davis’ book is The World According to Fannie Davis: My Mother’s Life in the Detroit Numbers. Criminal is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX.
