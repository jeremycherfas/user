Shocking revelations in this morning’s Guardian: [The cello and the nightingale: 1924 duet was faked, BBC admits](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/08/the-cello-and-the-nightingale-1924-duet-was-faked-bbc-admits). The recording of a bird joining Beatrice Harrison’s cello on a summer’s evening in 1924 has legendary status in certain circles. That some people have long had doubts about the bird — now revealed to be renowned _siffleur_ Maude Gould, _aka_ Madame Saberon, only makes me wonder about how people develop such expertise in any sphere. Practice, obvs.

Anyway, it reminded me of an astonishing evening when I had first arrived in Italy. I was living then in a lovely converted barn on a farm deep in the countryside. One evening, probably in April, I was on the phone to a radio colleague, one of the best I ever worked with, back in England. I could barely hear for the racket of birdsong.

“Hang on a minute,” I said. “I’ll just close the window.”  
“No, don’t. Those are nightingales. Let me listen.”

I knew he was an expert birder. I wonder whether he had guessed the BBC’s guilty secret. And now, having done a teeny bit of research, I really want to read [his new book](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/15/greenery-journeys-in-springtime-tim-dee-review).
