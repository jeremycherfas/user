I have a friend who identifies closely with [wombats](https://web.archive.org/web/20090301172015/http://wombatdiet.net/). Catching up on [magazine reading](https://www.economist.com/business/2008/12/30/generation-y-goes-to-work), I wonder whether he knew it was an acronym for Waste Of Money, Brains And Time? Somehow, and given aspects of our shared past, I feel he must have.
