No, my headline has nothing to do with the story, really. But I’m tired. Which is why I link without comment to [Ben Goldacre’s dissection](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/03/badscience.science) of the recent “GM-potatoes cause cancer” flare-up. I’ve got something cooking myself, which will go nicely with one of the comments Ben elicited, but it needs to simmer a few more hours.
