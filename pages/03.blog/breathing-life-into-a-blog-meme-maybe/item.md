As I continue reading previous blog posts written on this day, I’ve been struck by a couple of things. One is how often there didn’t seem to be anything worthwhile writing about, and how even writing about that seemed worthwhile. There was a phase when lots of bloggers were looking at their logs and writing about the strange searches that brought readers to them, probably only to be disappointed. Linked to that, there were blog carnivals and blog memes.[^3] 

===

Carnivals took a more-or-less specialised subject area and aggregated posts on that topic, usually submitted by the writer and often to a different host each time. The basic idea was that if your site occasionally played host to a rich source of good stuff from other sites, then people would be attracted to your site and maybe even stick around or add you to their blogroll. Taking turns at hosting shared the administrative load and the benefits that accrued. It was considered good practice to read all the submissions and craft your own post that would link to them, possibly exercising some selection, in a way that might entice readers to see for themselves. In that respect, because they were curated, blog carnivals to me are distinct from [planets](https://indieweb.org/planet) that merely accrete stuff, admittedly on a topic, without curation.

## Me, me, me

Blog memes were different, more a kind of pyramid scheme or chain letter. One blogger came up with an idea or a prompt, responded to it and then tagged other bloggers to respond, and tag, in turn. The underlying logic of why one should participate was not always that clear (to me). It might have been an early attempt to game page rank algorithms, because you linked back to the person who tagged you and forward to the people you were tagging. I don’t really know, but it did give you something to write.

Anyway … I’m not quite ready to launch a new blog carnival of my own. But when [I raised the topic 10 days ago](https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/2021/looking-at-an-old-post-of-mine) or so it got an enthusiastic response from a few people. And then, as serendipity would have it, an on-this-day post was a response to a blog meme. So, here we are.

## Have you ever …

In December 2008, I came across [this post](https://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/2008/12/have-you-ever.html) from someone who was on my blogroll, or in my feeds, or something. They listed 100 things that one might have done in one’s life, and invited one to indicate those that one had actually done. I [took the challenge on](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/lazy-blogging-just-one-of-the-things-ive-done) as a lark and then decided that the same list could prompt individual blog posts, so I [started doing that](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tid-0-explain-and-apologize).[^1] And now I’m resurrecting the meme, and tagging [Amanda Rush](https://arush.io/) and [ladyhope](https://hopesnotes.net/). I hope they will participate, link to this, and tag two more people.[^2] Of course, if you are inspired to do it too, then just go ahead.

[^2]: And just for a laugh I am also going to link to [What is a Blog Meme?](https://www.chrisg.com/what-is-a-blog-meme/) from Chris Garrett, just to see whether he will make good on an offer he made in 2007.

[^3]: There is a lot more I want to say prompted by these ideas, and with luck I do just that.
