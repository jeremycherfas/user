Rex's [longer article](http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-701.cfm) this week is, as he puts it, about "game culture -- and how it intersects with movies, music, and digital communication". A very interesting collection of thoughts. and even though I have never really been into computer games (except for a brief flirtation with RSI when Tetris first came out) I'm intrigued by his take on things. Especially the idea of blogging or doing iTunes playlists as a kind of computer game.

He also mentions a new PBS series on the [history of viedogaming](http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/index.html) which reminded me of a wonderful book called [Pilgrim in the Microworld](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446375217/104-3970239-0027908?v=glance). A very detailed account of how one person learned to play the most primitive computer game, I remember it as a fascinating read. And I see that David Sudnow has also rewritten the other book I know him for, Ways of the Hand, which is about learning to play jazz piano.

_18 September 2016: Just for fun, I looked at Google Trends for gamification. It didn't become a thing until three or four years after this._
