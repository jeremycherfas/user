Well duh. “Sleep is the new sex.” [Gretchen](https://happinessproject.typepad.com/happiness_project/2006/04/ive_been_gettin.html) has discovered that a good nap is ... a good thing. But she does also say that well-rested children sleep better than sleep-deprived children. This is news to me, childless as I am, but seems sensible. Rather like the best mousers being well-fed cats.
