Episode summary: Have you ever looked at a numerical claim and thought &lsquo;what on earth does that mean?&rsquo; Complex numbers are often badly communicated, making it difficult for the public to appreciate what they signify - but dial things down too much and you&rsquo;re at risk of oversimplifying important issues. It&rsquo;s a tightrope walk authors Chip Heath and Karla Starr have explored in their new book &lsquo;Making Numbers Count&rsquo;. Tim Harford talks to them about how we can improve the way we communicate numbers to the general public. Producer: Lizzy McNeill (Image: Child in front of numbers, Credit: Getty Images)
