Episode summary: SoS 64 The problematic history of lactase persistence research with Dr. Alice Yao — Sausage of Science — Overcast

Followed up the comment by Miranda Brown on ETP to this podcast (which I had to Huffduff, because) and very glad I did. I was (old white guy warning) completely unaware both of the difficulties with the label "lactose intolerant" and, even more so, with the crazed use being made of lactase persistence by the alt-right. I need to follow up, probably for ETP.
