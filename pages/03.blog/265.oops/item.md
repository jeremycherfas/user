Continuing my efforts to bring old stuff into this new bottle, I came across a post from 3 January 2006.

> my favourite list of 2005: [The Year in Media Errors and Corrections](http://www.regrettheerror.com/2005/12/crunks_05_the_y.html). The parent site looks worth bookmarking for future entertainment.

Alas, Wayback Machine knows it not. At least the link redirects to Regret the Error at Poynter. But here's the weird part: *there don't seem to have been any errors corrected since August 2015*.

Shurely shome mishtake.
