> Apple® today announced it is teaming up with Air France, Continental, Delta, Emirates, KLM and United to deliver the first seamless integration between iPod® and in-flight entertainment systems. These six airlines will begin offering their passengers iPod seat connections which power and charge their iPods during flight and allow the video content on their iPods to be viewed on the their seat back displays.

As someone with a preference for exactly those airlines, all I can say is how unimaginably cool I find Apple’s [announcement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/11/14Apple-Teams-Up-With-Air-France-Continental-Delta-Emirates-KLM-United-to-Deliver-iPod-Integration/).
