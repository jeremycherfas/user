Rome is not a cycle-friendly city. It could be, if the Romans could be persuaded to give up their beloved motor cars, of which, in 2008, there were [2.4 million to 2.5 million people](http://www.worldhum.com/features/how-to/cross_the_street_in_rome_20080226/). Not sure whether that is people people, or people old enough to drive. Either way, Rome has a higher car ownership per capita than any other European capital city. But I digress. As I must if I want to take a bike ride and blow out the cobwebs without risking life and limb. There are nice cycleways along the Tiber, north and south, very flat and pleasant, and a tad dull. The big park nearby is alright of a weekday morning, but at the weekend it is too full of people. So I just have to head out and hope for the best.

Last weekend I mostly went out in the direction of the neighbourhood where I used to live, in the hope that I wouldn't get too lost. [^fn1] And it was a really nice ride, half urban, half rural, with some pipe-opening climbs and some swooping downhills. Coming home up the beastly Portuense was no joke, but unavoidable. And I quite like seeing the [Corviale](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corviale) hulking up on the horizon as I peddle along the reserve below, flocks of sheep flowing biblically beneath the huge urban brute.

Today, though, strictly errands. I need to adapt the handlebars, which are a smidgen too low to be fully comfortable all the time. And other things.

[^fn1]: My GPS unit is great at telling me where I am, but not how to get where I want to be. 

*p.s. 15 September 2017: Because back then, it really was a GPS unit, not a fancy phone.*
