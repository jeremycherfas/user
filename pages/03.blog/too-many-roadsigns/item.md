[Arlington Road](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137363/) has Tim Robbins and Jeff Bridges in it; what’s not to like? The heavy-handedness and plethora of hints that all is not what it seems. That old saw “Just because you're paranoid …” gets a good working over, and the end is something of a surprise, in a movie-making industry addicted to resolution. But I’m glad I didn't spend real money on this one. 

My rating: 2 out of 5
