That’s irony, up there in the headline. Steven and Stephen (The Fabulous Freakonomics Brothers) point to a [competition, organized by Jews, for anti-Semitic cartoons](https://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2006/02/16/the-old-incentive-switcheroo/).

> “We'll show the world we can do the best, sharpest, most offensive Jew hating cartoons ever published! No Iranian will beat us on our home turf!”

So says the competition organizer, Amitai Sandy, [on the web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20060228194627/http://boomka.org/). Looking good so far.
