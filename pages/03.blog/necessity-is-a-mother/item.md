My friend Ton Zijlstra recently wrote about <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/09/15023/" >switching from TextExpander to Alfred</a >, prompted by TextExpander's move to a subscription model. I found myself in the same boat a while back, but wasn't entirely happy with the way Alfred handled that kind of text expansion. I replied to Ton, pointing out that I preferred TextExpander because “I don’t have to summon Alfred first”. 

Dumb, as I learned by actually reading about [Alfred Snippets in a bit more detail](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/) and as Ton gently pointed out.

Time to start transferring those snippets over, which is also a good opportunity to clean them up a bit, sort them out a bit, and consider a [collection wide affix](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/collections/#affix).

Thanks Ton for prompting me to do this.
