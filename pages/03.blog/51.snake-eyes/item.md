Yesterday, walking from the conference centre to the hotel, we found a dead snake on the pavement. Significant, or what? Turns out Ruth hasn't even seen Blade Runner. So the snake had no more than the usual curiosity value for her.

Dinner: more exceedingly fresh fishy stuff, flip-flapping and click-clacking all over the shop before it turned into fabulous food.
