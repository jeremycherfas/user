Episode summary: Arrangements of Bach&rsquo;s music have been happening essentially since his music was &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; by Mendelssohn in the 19th century. But Mozart and Beethoven arranged Bach&rsquo;s music too, and Bach himself would recycle works for different groupings of instruments. Today, I&rsquo;m going to take a look at some of those arrangements, and what kind of insights we can gain into Bach&rsquo;s music, the styles of the times in which these arrangements were done, and even(!) whether we might prefer these new flavors. Join us!

Lots of fun, and very informative, although I confess a small, secret part of me really wanted to hear something from Switched on Bach.
