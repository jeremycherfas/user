> 'The Lomas Financial Corp. is a perfectly hedged financial institution: It loses money in every conceivable interest-rate environment.'

I remember reading [Liar’s Poker](https://bookshop.org/a/13377/9780393338690) soon after it came out, and being both amazed and somewhat awed. [Michael Lewis’ recent article in Portfolio.com](http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom#) is pitch perfect.
