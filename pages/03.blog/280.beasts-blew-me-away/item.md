I'm not sure how long I've been waiting to see [Beasts of the Southern Wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125435/). There was a great article some time last year that made me write down the title and scour my usual haunts from time to time, each time coming up empty. So when a friend casually mentioned that she'd seen it here in Rome, and that it was subtitled, not dubbed, we dropped everything and rushed over. One of the weirder aspects of cinemas here is that I can never be sure when the programme changes, and I've missed stuff by waiting. So, anyway. Simply stunning. Magic realism or realistic magic, I don't care either way. It just sucked me and held me almost breathless. It was completely worth the wait. Beautiful to look at, with a stunning performance from everyone, not just the amazing Quvenzhan√© Wallis. Could she win Best Actress on Sunday? No idea; I haven't seen any of the other four nominees. But that was some performance.

My rating: 4.5 out of 5
