<blockquote>
<p>It turns out Kraft Dinner is tasty.</p>
<p>Who knew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I too have never knowingly eaten Kraft Dinner, but I can say that the whole world knew, because that's what industrial food does, and does it well. Homemade mac and cheese is even tastier, usually, but more work.</p>
<p>But <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://ruk.ca/content/bubblegum-and-basketballs">Peter Rukavina's point</a> is not really about Kraft Dinner. It is about making changes in one's life, and insight into that can come from anywhere, even a Kraft Dinner.</p>
