I just watched [Michelle Obama](https://www.ted.com/talks/michelle_obama_a_passionate_personal_case_for_education) tell the girls of [Elizabeth Garrett Anderson](https://www.egaschool.co.uk/) school that “being smart is the coolest thing in the world”. At last! Of course, in some sectors the very fact that **she** said it will reinforce the idea that being smart is uncool, but screw them. They’re losers anyway.

It’ll be interesting to see down the line whether [any of those girls](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/apr/05/michelle-obama-school-london) fingers Michelle for making them what some of them will surely become.
