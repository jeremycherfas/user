_This is really funny, given that I am now slowly and doggedly transferring long-past stuff out of WordPress and into Grav, which is a return to a good old static site like the one I produced with Tinderbox. Plus Ã§a change, eh?_

After considerable soul-searching and head scratching I decided to switch away from [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/) for publishing my whole blog and move to something a little more focussed. So here I am on WordPress, impressed. I may well continue to use write and publish, but will definitely not be maintaining the static pages that I was generating before. Lots of things to do, as ever when playing with a new toy.
	
  * Import some -- or all ? -- old posts from Tinderbox	
  * Work on the layout and stylesheets
  * Think about links
  * Work on an image gallery

That'll do to be getting on with.
