That was totally enjoyable, and I have no idea why I didn’t try it before. I wanted to watch a new documentary film, and I wanted to watch it in the company of a friend who is equally interested in the topic. So we fired up the film, got onto a Google Hangout together and just did it. And you know what? It just worked.

I half expected there to be technical difficulties but there were none. The hardest part was syncing when we started and paused the film -- three, two, one, pause -- and even so we were only a couple of seconds apart by the end. This wasn’t pure entertainment either. I’m hopeful it will bear podcastable fruit in a little while.
