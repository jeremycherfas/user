I had a doctor’s appointment today. The doctor didn’t show for at least an hour. He also wasn’t answering calls from his frazzled staff. I hope he’s OK and glad that my need wasn’t urgent and that I was able to rebook. I also took advantage of the enforced downtime to read <a class=”u-in-reply-to” href=”https://nicksimson.com/tags/26daysoftype/” >Nick Simson’s 26 Days of Type</a >, which had been on my to-read list for a while.

What a treat to learn so much about typefaces from someone who clearly knows what he is talking about and loves what he does. Thanks Nick. Thanks especially for the link to <a class=”u-in-reply-to” href=”https://maketypework.com/the-3-secrets-to-font-pairing/” >The 3 secrets to Font Pairing</a >. I’ve only skimmed that, and I’m not sure that as a rank amateur I have the skills to consider the emotion a typeface expresses or the similarity of curves. I’m going to try though.

And this is relevant because I am in the throes of redesigning one of my sites from the ground up, and with the scaffolding in position, it is time to consider typefaces and pairings. I have an anchor for body copy — Charter — and I _think_ I have a pairing for headlines etc. — CooperHewitt — but until I have done a fair bit more work, I won’t be sure.

Will I be sure even then? <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://nicksimson.com/posts/pairs/" >Nick Simson offers this advice</a >:

> Combining type is notoriously difficult. Because it isn’t easy, I think it’s worth doing well, and not outsourcing to something like AI. And I mean testing type combinations with real content, not abstract dummy text like lorem ipsum. It takes a human eye to figure out what feels right. Two typefaces that seem right on paper may not have the desired effect when put together.

So, yes, my barely-trained human eye will have to do the needful.
