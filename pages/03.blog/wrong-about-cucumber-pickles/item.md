There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to dill pickles. Witness this [second post in less than a week](https://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/24274/when-pickle) with details of salt quantities for [brine pickled cucumbers](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/cucumbers-and-a-recipe-but-no-dill/). But the real joy of the post is in what happened when David Snyder's wife questioned the safety of his pickles. Experts eventually deemed them perfectly safe, with a rider.

> Two weeks later, as good as her word, the Cooperative Extension Service Canning Consultant called me back. She had talked with the Cooperative Extension Service Pickle Consultant, and she had learned something new which she shared with me: “You have not made pickles,” she announced. “Pickles are made with vinegar. What you have made is fermented cucumbers.”

I don’t care what you call them, they still need more dill than I can currently muster.
