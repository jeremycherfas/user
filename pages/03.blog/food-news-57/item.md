Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.2 This week: 87.9

**Tuesday 7 August:** It is kind of hard to be sure that I’ve slipped down to a new plateau, but I certainly think I have. If I just look at the whole number of kilograms, there are more 87s in the past couple of weeks than there have been before. I’m not going to do the math, I’m just going to go ahead and feel the difference. Another couple of people, friends I hadn’t seen for a while, were asking about the procedure, and I do find it odd calling it a diet. It isn’t. Diets, in my very limited experience are prescriptive; they tell you what you can and cannot eat. The Shangri La Method (which I accept will not sell books) tells you what to do to feel less hungry. Acting on that is then up to you.
