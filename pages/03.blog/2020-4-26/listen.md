Episode summary: Urbanites are fleeing cities for beach communities and small country towns! Tensions are spreading faster than the Coronavirus. Your host turns to the last exhibition he saw in New York (Countryside the Future! from Rem Koolhaas) and the first dystopian film he watched in confinement (Michael Hanekeâ€™s Time of the Wolf) for answers. Plus a beach to beach chat with Helen and Martin from the Allusionist!
