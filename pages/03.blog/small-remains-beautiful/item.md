> [A] satisfactory answer to the specifically _political_ question of why legislators and government officials are spending so much time, money, and political capital attempting to regulate the buying and selling of raw milk. [Source](https://americasfuture.org/some-like-it-raw/)   

When it comes to food safety, big industry is simply a big bully. And government does the bully boys’ work. I’m frankly agnostic about whether clean raw milk is good or bad for one’s health, but the attempt to run it out of town on a rail is further evidence of the way in which food safety regulations have been subverted.

Thanks to [John Schwenkler](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/schwenkler/) for doing the legwork.
