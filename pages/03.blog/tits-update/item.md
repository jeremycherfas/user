Lovely morning for just sitting quietly in the sun waiting for the birds. And what a difference a bit of sun makes, because these were shot at 1/2000, which certainly helps.

There are absolutely, definitely nestlings present, but I have not heard a single chirp, nor do I want to spoil things by shining a light inside the head.
