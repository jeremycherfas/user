I’m shocked.

> Prayers offered by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart surgery, a large and long-awaited study has found.

And patients who knew they were being prayed for had a higher rate of post-operative complications like abnormal heart rhythms, perhaps because of the expectations the prayers created, the researchers suggested.

Not by the results, as reported in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/longawaited-medical-study-questions-the-power-of-prayer.html), but by the fact that anyone actually bothered. I’m not going to dredge up [Francis Galton’s study](https://www.abelard.org/galton/galton.htm). I am going to wonder what else one might have done with at least $4.7 million.

> The study cost $2.4 million, and most of the money came from the John Templeton Foundation, which supports research into spirituality. The government has spent more than $2.3 million on prayer research since 2000.
