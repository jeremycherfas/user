I love Sugru, and I admire and am grateful to Jane, its onlie true begetter, but when [someone on the internet is wrong](https://sugru.com/blog/looking-after-the-pilea-peperomioides-house-plant/), [duty calls](https://www.xkcd.com/386/).

> Dear the Jane

> See, that's weird. 

> Scientific names, like the names of people, just don't take a definite article. They are what linguists call strong proper names. So while I admire and appreciate your giving some attention to *Pilea peperomoides*, I find it odd to keep  reading about "the Pilea ...".

> Ideally, scientific names are shown in italics, and always without the definite article. So you can say "a _Pilea_" and "the Chinese money plant, pancake plant, lefse plant, or missionary plant". I got that last from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilea_peperomioides), and it is just one reason to give a scientific name, so we all know what we're talking about.

> As you can imagine, I've written about this sort of thing on my own website: If you're interested, start here: [Eagles point the way](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/eagles-point-the-way).

> Anyway, thanks for the article. I had no idea _Pilea_ was a relative of stinging nettle, and thanks to for Sugru.

> All the best

I know; I just can't help myself.
