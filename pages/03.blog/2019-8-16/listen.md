Episode summary: In July 2019, Leah Sottile and Ryan Haas sat down with OPB’s Dave Miller for a live Q&A event in Portland, Oregon. The discussion covered a range of topics, from how the second season of Bundyville came together to why conversations about white supremacy and extremist violence are necessary — even when those conversations are uncomfortable.
