_A [conversation posted to flickr by Dunstan Orchard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dunstan/2593161381/) and the ensuing comment-fest, prompted me to recall the following:_

So, a famous British Antarctic explorer is due to give a public lecture at Leeds Town Hall. The Mayor of Leeds gets up on the podium and says:  

“Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my very great pleasure tonight to welcome the famous Antarctic explorer, [Sir Vivian Fucks](http://www.sirvivianfuchs.com/).”

Sir Vivian, for it is he, tugs on the Mayor’s sleeve:  

“Actually it’s Fooks.”

“I know that laddie,” says the Mayor, “but I couldn’t say so in pooblic, now could I?”
