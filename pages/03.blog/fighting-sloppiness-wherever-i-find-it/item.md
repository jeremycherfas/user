![screenshot of headline Dryland regions unite to combat food security](Drylands.png){.center}

I don’t know why [people complain about the quality of science reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/jun/28/1) these days. As any fule kno, [“combat” is a synonym of "boost"](https://www.scidev.net/global/news/dryland-regions-unite-to-combat-food-security/).[^fn1] A Science Journalist told me so. I know, lets blame the subs.

[^fn1]: Or was when I grabbed the screenshot.

! 2022-08-01: And amazingly, it was [still there today](https://web.archive.org/web/20220801071021/https://www.scidev.net/global/news/dryland-regions-unite-to-combat-food-security/). That’s how much influence I have in the greater scheme of things.
