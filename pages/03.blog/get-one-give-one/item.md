A couple of weeks ago someone shared a list of things that people can’t help themselves but recommend to others, things that are so useful or worthwhile that you can’t imagine how you lived without them.[^2] Of course I skimmed through it. There were things I’m already doing (plain text) and things I’m never going to do (children)[^1]. There were also things that elicited a masssive “Huh?”

===

But then, when people piled on to the huh?-advice, I thought, maybe there’s something to this. So I took a look at the [Better Bow Shoelace Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/betterbowknot.htm) on Ian's Shoelace Site. Genius. The entire site. And even more so that particular knot. It takes a bit of practice, but it is super worthwhile. Just as secure as a double bow, but a whole lot easier to undo when you need to. I shall be recommending this to anyone who’ll listen, and probably to a few who won’t.

In that spirit, what’s the one _other_ thing I recommend? Far infrared heat panels. Each winter in this apartment, I have frozen during the inevitable cold snaps. Hot-water bottles, fingerless gloves, a blanket round my shoulders. All just temporary relief. Then a friend told me about far infrared panels. I did a bit of research, bought one, and installed it under my desk. Bliss. I’m fully prepared to admit that I don’t understand all the physics, but I get enough of it to know that it isn’t all woo. [Far Infrared Heating. It’s heating, Jim, but not as we know it!](https://www.acchaus.com/blog/far-infrared-heating-its-heating-jim-but-not-as-we-know-it/) does a good job of putting it all in context (against a UK background).

If the day ever comes when I own a property or have permission to renovate one, I would seriously consider FIR for all the things. In the meantime, if you’re cold, especially at your desk, you owe it to yourself to at least take a look.
