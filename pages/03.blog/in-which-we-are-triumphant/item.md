Even in the contest between man and patio furniture, the issue is not certain.

The key to the communal terrace above having been obtained from the porter, the armchairs were squeezed through the doorway and lowered onto the terrace by means of mountaineering tape. Would the larger sofa fit? It would not. OK, so we take it out onto the balcony, though the bedroom window, lift it from there onto the terrace, carry it across the terrace, and lower it onto our terrace. And the amazing part is, it worked. Score one to the men, zero to the patio furniture.
