My latest piece for NPR's The Salt went up yesterday: [Your Quinoa Habit Really Did Help Peru's Poor. But There's Trouble Ahead](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/31/472453674/your-quinoa-habit-really-did-help-perus-poor-but-theres-trouble-ahead). The nice part about it, quite apart from the work I reported and the researchers who gave freely of their time and expertise, is in that one word: but.

The quinoa story is complicated, with lots of twists and turns, and I am really grateful to have been given enough space to explore some of the complications in some depth.
