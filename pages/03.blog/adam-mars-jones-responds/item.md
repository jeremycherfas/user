Over at the other place, [a response](http://agro.biodiver.se/2012/06/purple-potato-power/) from someone very close to Mr Mars-Jones, about [that metaphor](blog/calling-adam-mars-jones/).

> We have been informed, albeit at second hand, that Mr Mars-Jones did not mean his recent remark about purple potatoes to be in any way pejorative.

>> I know that purple potatoes exist, and I put that together with the stereotypical purple-faced racist ranter… no derogatory reference to particular strains of potato was intended…

> We are as relieved to hear it as we are pleased that references to genebanks are now considered appropriate in literary book reviews.

Job done.
