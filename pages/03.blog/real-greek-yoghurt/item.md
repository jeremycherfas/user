[Aglaia Kremezi](http://www.aglaiakremezi.com/) has the straight dope on Greek yoghurt.[^fn1] The stuff she ate as a child was not thick and creamy. Imagine that! If thick and creamy was required for a dish of, say, tzatziki, her family strained it specifically. Thatâ€™s a relief; I can carry on with my home made stuff, straining if I must. She also relates how Greek yoghurt, as the rest of us know it, came to be.

> By a very strange coincidence, our yogurt man was Mr. Filippou, the grandfather (or the great uncle) of the present owners of FAGE, the company that has extended its yogurt business all over the world. From their little workshop in Patissia the family created the first yogurt factory in Athens. The name of the company--now one of the largest food businesses in Greece--is pronounced FAH-yeh, an acronym from Filippou Adelfoi Galaktokomikes Epicheriseis (the Filippou Brothers Dairy Company), a word that felicitously means "eat!" in Greek.

How did they achieve domestic and then world domination? [Read the whole piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/06/greece-home-of-yogurt-perfection/18690/).
