_This post is number 49 in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

I was sitting quietly, waiting for him, and he threw something at my head. I watched it sail by. A biscuit! So I Hoovered it up. That happened a couple more times, then his aim improved. I happened to have my mouth open, and in it went. Well, that was easier than having to find it on the ground and Hoover it up. So next time, I opened my mouth. He got it in again. Now he’s almost perfectly trained, and gets it in two out of three times. Who says you can’t teach an old guy new tricks?
