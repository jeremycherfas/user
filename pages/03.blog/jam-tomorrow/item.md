A post over on [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/2005/11/18/making-profits-from-incivility-on-the-roads/) let me discover [Science Hobbyist on Traffic Jams](http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html) -- much of which I already knew, but the experiments he describes are just wonderful. I often try the “evaporate jam” thing myself, by idling along as slowly as I can in traffic; the problem is that Italians, like nature, abhor a vacuum, so the space I am carefully  opening up in front of my car is rapidly filled by idiots. Still, it is good to have a better feeling for traffic waves. Something to think about while stuck, too.
