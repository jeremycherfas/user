[More](https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1632504/posts), indeed more than you might possibly want, on the [delights of asparagus](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/mything-tips).

> Those who adore asparagus, it turns out, tend to be “dramatic, theatrical people who like to be the centre of attention,” says Hirsch. They're also “lively, enthusiastic, flirtatious, provocative and seductive,” with a penchant for “flights of romantic fantasy.”
