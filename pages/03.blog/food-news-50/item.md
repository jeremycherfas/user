Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.9 This week: 88.3  
**Tuesday 19 June:** Can it really be 50 weeks since I started this in earnest? Yes, it can. And I’ve been thinking a bit about why I seem to have plateaued, big-time. The simple answer is that I’m not far off where I want to be. No motivation. So the morning cornetto, which I managed without for a long time, is back on the regular menu. And I don’t feel at all bad about that, because it is a plateau and not an upward creep. On the other hand, looking at the numbers, would it not be cool to look back on a year and know that I had dumped 10 whole kilograms? It would.
