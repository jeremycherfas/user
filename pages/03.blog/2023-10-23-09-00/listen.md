Episode summary: This week David talks to the novelist Zadie Smith about Charles Dickens: what he means to her, why we still read him, and what&rsquo;s missing from the Dickensian view of the world. It&rsquo;s a conversation about other writers as well &ndash; Turgenev, George Orwell and Toni Morrison &ndash; and about whether fiction shows us how to live or rather helps us to see the ways in which the truth about how we live is hidden from view.Zadie Smith&rsquo;s new novel is The Fraud, available now. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.
