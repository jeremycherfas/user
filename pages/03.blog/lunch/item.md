Not entirely unexpected, I donâ€™t suppose, although our hosts were remarkably reluctant to confirm it. Mine was delicious, stuffed with some sort of plum or prune. And there was good rice too, mixed with steamed or boiled giant corn kernels. All in all considerably more exciting than the _chifa_ I've had on other occasions.
