Spare a pair of panties for peace. Send them to the nearest embassy of Myanmar. Why panties? There’s a full explanation here ~~http://leahbowe.com/deathpower/2007/11/02/panty-protest-against-burmese-government/~~.

I’ve been away from the internets and hadn’t seen that this story had received a bit of coverage. The campaign remains a smart piece of thinking. But wouldn’t it just be better for a bunch of skirted women to climb to the top floor of every Burmese embassy and stay there?

2021-11-08: No sign of the original post, any more. But there is evidence of it's passing.

* [Cernig's Newshog: Panty Raid!](https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2007/10/panty-raid.html)
* [Small Ways to Protest an Oppressive Government](https://www.newsweek.com/small-ways-protest-oppressive-government-82055)  

And I cannot help wonder why the campaign has not found new strength of late. Or have Burmese men evolved to the point where they are no longer scared of women’s undies?
