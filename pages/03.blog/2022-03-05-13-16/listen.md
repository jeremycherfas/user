Episode summary: The trial is underway but the accused men in the dock seem almost proud of what they did. Some of the Nazi documents are chilling but there are simply too many of them. It will need something much more real to show the world the enormity of their crimes. And soon it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a danger of the American team relying too heavily on documents alone &ndash; the trial is becoming bogged down. The Defendants are even starting to feel they&rsquo;re winning&hellip;until the American Prosecutors change tack and show a 60-minute film of footage taken at the Concentration Camps. Nobody has seen anything like it. The courtroom is reduced to silence, the defendants finally cowed. Featuring Hari Dhillon as Colonel Robert Storey, Deputy American Prosecutor, and Andrew Woodall as Adolf Hitler. Tatiana Sablikova - AMANDA RYAN Robert H Jackson - JOSEPH MYDELL Sir Geoffrey Lawrence - NICHOLAS WOODESON Robert Storey - HARI DHILLON Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe - FORBES MASSON Hermann Goering - NIGEL LINDSAY Julius Streicher - HENRY GOODMAN Wilhelm&hellip;
