The things some people will stoop to.  I was amazed to discover that the second most popular bookmark on del.icio.us when I looked a minute ago was [13 things that do not make sense](https://web.archive.org/web/20051104023034/http://www.sixside.com/13_things_that_do_not_make_sense.htm). Well, that's not so amazing. What is amazing is that whoever sixside is gave no credit whatsoever to [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524911-600-13-things-that-do-not-make-sense/), which is where the post was taken from, almost word for word. Of course I found the NS article by Googling a phrase from the post. And Google reveals that at least two other web-wastrels linked to the original by quoting the same part of it. But at least [Tyler Cowen](https://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/03/13_scientific_p.html) and [Flemming Funch](http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001492.htm) credited New Scientist.

Why care? Because if _hoi polloi_ are going to be grassroots journalists, they need to learn to give credit where credit is due.
