I enjoy Dave Eggers' writing a lot, and this was no exception. He has a deft way of filling in the back story that I admire, and his treatment of the two young children seems to me absolutely accurate, poignant and touching and funny. The adventures that these heroes get into are many and varied and give a definite impression of how life just carries one along, given half a chance. Highly enjoyable.

The ending may disappoint some people. It did me, truth be told, for about 15 minutes. And then, thinking more about it, I decided it made perfect sense.

*My notes here are just sentences I found notably deft for one reason or another.*
