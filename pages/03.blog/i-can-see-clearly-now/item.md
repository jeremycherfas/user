“It’s a lot like the old days of trying to get a good colour print at home,” was the best I could come up with. “You print one of those test images that came with the printer, with all those different skin colours, and you discover that the pretty pink baby actually has a slight green tinge.”

A week ago, I went under the knife, as it were, for what I subsequently learned was [The World’s Most Common Surgery](https://www.asimov.press/p/cataracts?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me), to replace the lens in my right eye. To tell the truth, it hadn’t really been bothering me all that much. Just that last year, when I decided my old specs really weren’t working all that well any more, I was surprised when the optician told me that my prescription hadn’t changed, and that possibly the deterioration in my vision was because of the cataracts.

Preparation is a bit of a faff, and of course it is scary to think too much about what the surgeon is actually going to do. A friend had told me that “the sedatives they give you are really good”. It was all thoroughly business-like. Did they give me a sedative? I honestly do not know. I do know that there was some strange touch-based sensation, not in the least bit painful or distressing, and a very engaging light show as they did what they had to do, rather like the old oil and water light shows at Pink Floyd gigs in the 60s.

When it was over, and despite the massive dilation of my pupil, I could see well through that eye. And everything seemed somehow cleaner and brighter. I closed the new eye, and white surfaces especially, but also pink skin, were covered with a light green film, just like those test prints of old. Without that comparison, it would have been hard to believe that anything had changed.

I’m adjusting to needing to have reading glasses with me most of the time, and enjoying not needing specs at all otherwise. After 68 years, that’s quite a change. Can’t wait for the second eye to be cleaned up.
