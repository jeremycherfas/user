Episode summary: This month, we’re welcoming our brand-new show Adult ISH to the network by diving into the Radiotopia producers’ childhood dream jobs — everything from a firefighter to a singer to a line cook. In this episode, you’ll hear: Merk Nguyen, Nyge Turner, Hrishikesh Hirway, Helen Zaltzman, Benjamen Walker, Jen Poyant, Manoush Zomorodi, Ian Chillag, Jonathan Mitchell, Phoebe Judge, Nate DiMeo, Dave Nadelberg and Davia Nelson. Go take a listen to Adult ISH, and then head over to the Radiotopia Citizens Facebook Group to tell us what you think of the show! And finally, we want to remind you all that we have Radiotopia merch for sale! Grab a T-shirt, camping mug, water bottle or a perfect beach tote.
