A speaker at a meeting I was at this morning, about agricultural biodiversity and nutrition, said that fortified sugar was now on the market. There was a knowing chuckle from some in the audience, which nicely hid my gobsmacked ignorance. First chance I got, I checked. And blow me if it isn't true: [white sugar laced with iron and vitamin A](https://web.archive.org/web/20060515154744/http://www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/htm/fortisugar.htm).

> With the present nutritional status of Filipinos being deficient in micronutrients like iron and vitamin A, the market for products like double-fortified sugar is very lucrative in Institutional and commercial levels.

Yeah, right. I suppose leafy vegetables and orange fruits (mango anyone? papaya?) just arenâ€™t modern enough. Or lucrative enough.

! 2022-02-16: I checked; it is still happening, at least in [Nigeria](https://www.reuters.com/companies/DANGSUG.LG). Probably [elsewhere too](https://nutrition.basf.com/global/en/human-nutrition/food-fortification/applications/sugar.html).
