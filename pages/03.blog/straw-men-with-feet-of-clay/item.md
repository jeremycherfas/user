I don't believe this. Stephen J. Dubner, the journalist half of Freakonomics, has totally blown it. In the [Freakonomics blog for the New York Times](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724192426/https://freakonomics.com/2008/07/08/dept-of-oops/) he writes:

> The Economist is, almost inarguably, a great magazine.
> 
> That doesn’t mean it doesn't make the occasional mistake. Consider this lead from a recent article about a huge Mexican mining company called Fresnillo, which was recently listed on the London Stock Exchange:
> 
> In the hills north east of Mexico City it is not uncommon to find Cornish pasties for sale.
> 
> They meant to write “pastries” but, considering that miners work really hard, they might also be hoping to encounter the kind of people who go shopping for pasties.
> 
> I have made plenty of similar errors myself. I read this mistake in the print edition of The Economist and fully expected it to be corrected in the online edition — but, as of when I included the link above, it hadn’t been.

As every commenter pointed out, the joke is on him. I hope he has the cojones not to correct himself.
