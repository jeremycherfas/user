Björn over at 5¢ense [points to a brief report](https://5cense.com/11/5c_flash_Q2_2011.htm), that the godlike J Craig Venter was slapped with a cease-and-desist by the estate of James Joyce, for daring to encode a Joyce quote in the DNA of the microbe Venter built. 

“To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.”

What [an utter prat that estate](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/19/the-injustice-collector) surely is.

Better yet, as I learned from a [more detailed report of the debacle](https://blogs.forbes.com/davidewalt/2011/03/14/craig-venters-genetic-typo/) ...

> The synthetic DNA also included a quote from physicist Richard Feynman, “What I cannot build, I cannot understand.”  
> That prompted a note from Caltech, the school where Feyman [sic] taught for decades. They sent Venter a photo of the blackboard[^fn1] on which Feynman composed the quote – and it showed that he actually wrote, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.”  
> “We agreed what was on the Internet was wrong,” said Venter. “So we’re going back to change the genetic code to correct it.”

And excise the Joyce, presumably.
