Apologies if you subscribe to the feed here and discovered it wasn’t working. The problem lay with a plugin that does the necessary work, and I believe it is now fixed. Not that there has been much to see here lately, and that’s part of the problem, because although I do subscribe to my own feed in order to monitor that it is working, if I haven’t published anything, there’s nothing to see. Thanks to <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a> for alerting me.
