Episode summary: The United States had a pandemic plan. But when a pandemic came, we hesitated to follow it. The country was hobbled by argument and doubt. Much of that doubt came from experts who proposed that Covid might not be as lethal as scientists feared. Michael Lewis returns to the subject of his latest book, The Premonition, to understand why it&rsquo;s so hard to trust the truest signs of expertise: a willingness to follow the evidence.

What an absolutely wonderful episode. It could not have been more clearly laid out how culpable some people proved to be when tempted by fame, glory and a public spotlight. And more than a million people died.
