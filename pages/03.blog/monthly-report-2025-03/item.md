Once again, later than it “ought” to be, but this time the answer is simple: holidays. A glorious couple of weeks tooling around Sicily with one of my best, and longest-standing, friends and the Squeeze. If I wanted to delay this round-up even more, I’d focus first on writing that up, but I won’t.

===

## Highlights of the month:
- A redesign of this very space that you are reading now, most of which works the way I want it to
- Learned how dangerous I can be in a remote terminal session, and also how to recover
- The Squeeze’s final (?) show at Temple Rome Gallery; a huge success
- Plants on the terrace starting to move along, so gardening resumed
- Sowed seven kinds of home-saved seeds; only two good (Cupani’s sweetpea and a pink-flowered morning glory)
- Counting crochet stitches as you go is boring but it works
- Good visits with friends I haven’t seen in a while
- Abandoned Apple Music for Jellyfin; rapidly abandoned Jellyfin for Navidrome
- Then, Tailscale. Miraculous!
- No line for the Pantheon, so in for the first time since Covid
- Tropea! Catania! Palermo! Monreale!

### Stuff Done
Very impressed with the stats from [OP3](https://op3.dev). I gushed last month about the excellent data visualisation, and I’m still finding it a revelation. It would be nice (and probably not too difficult) to download the data in a way that would allow me to add a marker on a day in which I am able to promote an episode from the back catalogue to see whether that might possibly influence downloads in the real world. But then, as I also said before, I don’t actually do anything with the information except feel good. And sometimes bad.

Previous years are still on [an archive page](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/working-life).

### Goals

Seven posts again, and this month I take comfort that I was having a fine time not writing about the holiday.

### Niggles

None.

### Final remarks

Not something I’ve really written up, but spending some time every evening listening to music and doing something mindful with my hands has been a real pleasure and one I hope to continue.
