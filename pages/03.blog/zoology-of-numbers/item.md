[Rebecca](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2006/05/what_is_special_about_this_num.html) sends me to [What's special about this number](http://www.archimedes-lab.org/numbers/Num1_69.html), a total delight. And the first entry, under âˆš-1,[^1] reminds me that I meant to thank the BBC's In Our Time podcast on negative numbers, a few weeks back, for enlightening me about a road near where I live over in ScienceLand. Via. G. Cardano commemorates the man who discovered _i_. Not a lot of people know that. For even more juicy tidbits, including wonderful stuff about renaissance mathematical competitions, you'll have to dig up the podcast.

_What's special about this number_ prompted a recollection of [Martin Gardner's filing system](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n2_v22/ai_20562400/pg_11). And lo, Google spewed it.[^2]

And then, I wondered whether Gardner would have found hyperlinks and computers useful for his sort of thing, and I wondered whether he was still alive, and I searched and searched and became very frustrated that I never did act on my brilliant idea of some years back to start a web site called "Are they dead" and then I came across [Dead People Server](http://dpsinfo.com/dps/) and I am grateful to Laurie D.T. Mann who informed me that the old guy (born 1914) is [still alive](http://www.gamepuzzles.com/martin.htm).[^3]

I think.

[^1]: 2019-10-15 Now the second entry, after NaN, which seems somehow very meta.

[^2]: Not any more. I can't find anything now.

[^3]: Not any more. [Martin Gardner](https://www.famousscientists.org/martin-gardner/).
