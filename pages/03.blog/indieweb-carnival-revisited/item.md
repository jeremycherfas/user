The launch of a new blog carnival was so exciting that I wrote my own summary, even though I was not the host. That job was [very ably performed by Sara Jak≈°a](https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/07/carnival-of-indieweb-june-2023-edition-indieweb-and-cooking-roundup-post/), who launched the carnival. The point of [my roundup](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/indieweb-and-cooking-my-roundup) was to visit each of the sites and, by way of encouragement, send a webmention to each of them.

Naturally, I was very happy that Sara <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/07/reply-to-indieweb-and-cooking-my-roundup-by-jeremy/" >said she enjoyed it</a >. However, it shames me that she thinks it is better written than her own roundup, given that English is my mother tongue and that I couldn't possibly have written it in any other language, unlike Sara. That it was also "more fun to read" is gratifying and gives me joy, the topic of [this month's IndieWeb Carnival](https://jamesg.blog/2023/07/01/indieweb-carnival/).

So, no desire to steal anyone's thunder, and happy to have been of use.
