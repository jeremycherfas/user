In some respects there are just three seasons to our year.

  1. Too dark to walk down by the river, morning and evening.
  2. Light enough in the morning, too dark in the evening.
  3. Light enough at both ends.
Today we passed from 1 to 2. Without rushing home, it was just about light enough to ensure that I wouldnâ€™t tread in anything nasty, and Mel seemed to me to be pretty happy about that. Me too, for her.
