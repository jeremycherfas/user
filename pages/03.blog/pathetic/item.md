It is pathetic, I know, to seek inspiration in the errors of others, as I have done now two posts in a row. But it really is such a source of pleasure, even when I know I am surely setting myself up for retribution. But who can resist the [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3255972/Harry-Potter-fails-to-cast-spell-over-Professor-Richard-Dawkins.html) getting Richard Dawkinsâ€™ name wrong? And even more amazingly, when you google Prof Hawkins, who should be top of the list but young Stephen Hawking. Something very god is going on.
