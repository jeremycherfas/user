I like the idea of barter; I just haven't been able to make it work, yet. I say this because 7.5 years ago I <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/a-food-community/" >dared to dream</a >  of a working, small-scale food community. The point is that for many home-made food processes, doing it in bulk is often easier than small quantities, and that means you have a surplus. But turning a hobby into a business can turns a pleasure into a chore. The solution is barter.

I'll make the bread, the yoghurt, the sauerkraut. What have you got to offer, other than cash?
