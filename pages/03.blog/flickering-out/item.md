_This post is number 43 in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

My latest camera download contained about 170 images from at least four trips. And I’m resolved not to get behindhand in organizing them. So I sat down to rank, keyword, catalogue and upload one of the trips, and before I know it I’ve spent an extra hour wandering the byways of Flickr, which is getting too big. Not that I’m elitist ... but so much duplication and inanity.

And I wonder, just because I’ve taken [a bunch of pictures](https://flickr.com/photos/jcherfas/sets/72157604694376002/) that I’m proud of, why do I find it necessary to find a group (just one???) and foist them on complete strangers?
