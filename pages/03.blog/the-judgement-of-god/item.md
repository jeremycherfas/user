Doing a bit of research recently for a future podcast, I came across this astonishing little passage.

> “The judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the <span style="color: white;">Irish</span> a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated … The real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the <span style="color: white;">Famine</span>, but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.”

I’ve blanked out who was being taught a lesson, and what was teaching them a lesson; it’s easy enough to find out. But oh my, with the smallest of misunderstandings, that “the people” are not those being taught a lesson, but those teaching them, and the whole thing makes perfect sense today.

The original also made sense back when, to a certain group, but it was wrong then and is wrong today.
