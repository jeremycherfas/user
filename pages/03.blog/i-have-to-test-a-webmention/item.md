Sometimes, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

Like <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://stream.jeremycherfas.net/2020/fourierfiend-the-simplest-syndication-tool-in-many" >send a webmention</a > to himself. Because <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://boffosocko.com/2020/09/11/55776585/" >someone else was getting an error</a > when they tried to send one.

And then, maybe, I can try using Telegraph to resend Chris' original.
