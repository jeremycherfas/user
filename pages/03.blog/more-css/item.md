Swotting up on CSS, with my nose buried in _Cascading Style Sheets: designing for the web_ by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. Full of very useful information, more accessible (to me) than Eric Meyer’s _Cascading Style Sheets 2.0_. I’ve isolated many things I need to do in the future to clean up the stylesheets I have been working on, like making full use of inheritance and ensuring consistent measurements. But on a whim, and with some trepidation, I submitted this page to the [W3C Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). And lo! It validates![^1] Another little button to clutter up the bottom of my right hand menu.

Maybe I should try validating the HTML?

The remaining big question? Can I now arrogantly ignore the vast majority of users who are stuck with IE6 for Windows?
