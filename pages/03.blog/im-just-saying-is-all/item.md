Over at [The Other Place](https://agro.biodiver.se/) I have ongoing discussions with Luigi (while we wait for the call from G****e) about the differences between momentary measures and long-term trends. He likes the former. I prefer the latter. [^fn1] But when he IMed me to say we our Google-fu was powerful, I had to go over and check. And then I had to record what I saw. But here, in order to avoid possible hubris.

That’s for “agricultural biodiversity,” which has always been my favoured term anyway. The galling part is that “agrobiodiversity” is not up there, and above it is a pure shell with, as yet, no content.

[^fn1]: Like all generalizations, that one isn't worth a damn.
