Prompted by Ton Zilstra, who has now <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/09/15041/" >completed the job</a >, I [started](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/necessity-is-a-mother) making a deliberate effort to move all my text expansions from TextExpander to Alfred, and for simply expanding text it works a treat. Along the way, I picked up a [super-useful tip](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/15827-red-not-valid-snippets/?tab=comments#comment-80679) from Vero, Alfred's Mum. 

===

TextExpander allows one trigger to be a subset of another, so `.j` expands to Jeremy and `.jc` expands to Jeremy Cherfas. Alfred requires a space after the trigger to distinguish the two. But … Alfred allows you to set a suffix, like a space, for an entire collection of snippets, which makes each snippet unique. Yay!

The problem, for me, is that I also use TextExpander to run scripts that do things beyond expanding text. For example, if I type `thmo` TextExpander runs an Applescript that inserts “this Monday (5 October 2020)”. Running a script of any sort in Alfred is a lot more complicated (at least to me, a non-developer).

There are some absolutely brilliant Alfred Workflows that incorporate very powerful scripts, and I have been trying to unpack those and learn from them, but it has been slow going.

My conclusion, so far, is that Alfred is a much more powerful tool than TextExpander and that I have been using very little of that power. Text expansion is a relative doddle compared to all the other things Alfred can do, and seeing as I am paying for it, I may as well try to make more use of it.
