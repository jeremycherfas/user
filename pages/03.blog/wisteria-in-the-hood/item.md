The abundant wisteria in the neighbourhood looks much better to the eye than to the camera. No matter. 

I had hoped to be able to solve a mystery for this post; why do Italians call wisteria _glicine_?  To me, the Greek root for glycine is associated with sweetness, although the plant that springs to mind is _Glycine max_, the not-noticeably sweet soybean. [Wikipedia enlightened me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean#Classification). Linnaeus used it in 1737, in reference to the sweet, pear-shaped tubers of what he called _Glycine apios_. That turns out to be my old friend _Apios americana_, sometimes known as Indian Potato, which my other old friend Rhizowen wants us all to call [Hopniss](http://radix4roots.blogspot.it/2011/06/have-hopniss-am-happy.html).

Good to know. 

English speakers call the flower [wisteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria) because Thomas Nuttall named it for the Philadelphia physician Caspar Wistar. And Wisteria was previously classified as Glycine.

Mind you, I'm no closer to knowing why Italians call wisteria _glicine_. Maybe they're still using the old form; that would be understandable. It can't be something as simple as the sweet smell, can it?
