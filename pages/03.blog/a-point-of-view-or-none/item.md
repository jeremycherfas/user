Friend [Derek has been digging into a recent Harper's Weekly poll](https://www.5cense.com/11/5c_flash_Q3_2011.htm) showing that more Americans (76%) say they would vote for a homosexual than for an atheist (49%). This, he notes, is a change on 1988, when the same poll -- different people? -- gave 26% to 31%. Derek’s conclusion:

> Americans are putting more trust into those with dissenting views than those with a lack of any view.

Well, maybe so, but I reject the characterisation of atheists as lacking any point of view. My view is that grown-ups don’t need fairy stories to console them or big, bad father figures to keep them on the straight and narrow.
