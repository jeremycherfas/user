Escaped from the meeting rooms for lunch, which has been declining ever so gradually from day 1. So four of us ended up at the Bamerette diner, part of the Hotel Bamer, just up the road. Neat-o! Very fifties, with a dude in the corner -- shades, slim tie, guitar -- who was just passing time. We ate well, luxuriating in the bright light of day and, though we love them dearly, the absence of our friends and colleagues. I had chile rellenos, my colleagues chicken tacos. We Were wondering whether we couldn't just spend the entire afternoon there. But no, there was no wi-fi. So how would we communicate our good fortune to the rest of the world? Answer: back to work.

That's going well enough too. Two tasks for this afternoon. First, to trace four packages that were sent from Rome. When I arrived the desk said they were here. But I was too tired to go and get them immediately. Yesterday I asked again. No sign. Today I used the magic package tracking, which is indeed truly magical. They're here, for sure. But where? Checked out various hidey holes with the concierge, but they were nowhere. So he's taking care of it for me now. I hope. Task two is a snappy paragraph describing the activity I have undertaken to lead next year. So that's next.
