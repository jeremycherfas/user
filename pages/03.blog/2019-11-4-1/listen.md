Episode summary: “I started dancing with Eveline.” A final twist in the final chapter. Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Helena Merriman tells the extraordinary true story of a man who dug a tunnel into the East, right under the feet of border guards, to help friends, family and strangers escape. The series is based on original interviews with the survivors as well as thousands of documents from the Stasi archives and recordings from the tunnel. Producer & Presenter: Helena Merriman Sound Design: Eloise Whitmore Translation and additional research: Sabine Schereck Editor: Richard Knight #tunnel29

If you've been paying attention here, you might think I skipped to the final episode in the series. You would be wrong. There is a logical flaw somewhere in my program for doing these postings that only gets the last episode listened since the previous run. So the misssing episodes here reflect a mini-binge in which I uscked up the final three episodes on a flight. 

Wow but this was a great production. The story itself was pretty amazing, but more amazing still was the sound design, which lifted this way above the ordinary. Huge kudos to [Eloise Whitmore](http://nakedproductions.co.uk/) for that. Cannot recommend the series too highly.

That logical flaw, in the meantime, can wait. I'm not normally a binge-listener.
