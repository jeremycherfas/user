A real downer of a post from Michael Lewis of [searchmysite.net](https://searchmysite.net). He reports that [Almost all searches on my independent search engine are now from SEO spam bots](https://blog.searchmysite.net/posts/almost-all-searches-on-my-independent-search-engine-are-now-from-seo-spam-bots/). On some days, no human used his search engine. I regret that I am one of those absent humans.

What to do?

One thing I could do myself would be to be more mindful when searching and not simply curse the spam that clogs every search engine.

More generally, and this is beyond my expertise, I wonder whether there are browser extensions. I have just suggested a !bang at DuckDuckGo but I do not know enough about how to get authorisation to get it to actually work there. Still, maybe they will be able to make it work.

Until then, mindfulness it is.
