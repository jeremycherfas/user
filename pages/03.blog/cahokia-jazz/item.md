See, this is what happens when you procrastinate.

I've been putting off reviewing *Cahokia Jazz*, which I finished a couple of months ago, because I wanted to tie it in to knowing a teeny bit about Cahokia from *The Dawn of Everything* and my subsequent discovery of *Red Plenty*, also by Francis Spufford, which was a terrific read too.

And then I discover, today, because he rounded up all his [reviews of the previous 12 months](https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/02/booklish/), that an [internet God had read and reviewed it](https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/04/cahokia/#the-sun-and-the-moon) a year ago. Here's Cory Doctorow's lede:

> Francis Spufford's *Cahokia Jazz* is a fucking *banger*: it's a taut, unguessable whuddunit, painted in ultrablack noir, set in an alternate Jazz Age in a world where indigenous people never ceded most the west to the USA. It's got gorgeously described jazz music, a richly realized modern indigenous society, and a spectacular romance. It's *amazing*

Read the whole thing, which is better then I would produce now. Perhaps the only thing I have in common with Doctorow, aside from loving the book, is this:

> Most of what I know about Cahokia ... I learned from David Graeber and David Wengrow's brilliant work of heterodox history, *The Dawn of Everything*

I thought Cahokia Jazz might be Doctorow's No. 1 in popularity, but it is only the first one in his list. That means I have to look through the rest for some new reads for myself.
