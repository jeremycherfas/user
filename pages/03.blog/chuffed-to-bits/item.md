![Graph of site visitors showing a very slight uptick](slimview.png){.left} Two of my recent posts have been singled out for mention in a couple of blog carnivals: [Tangled Bank](https://digitalbio.blogspot.com/2006/04/tangled-bank-51-seattle-tour_11.html) and [Carnival of the Liberals](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615163503/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/04/carnival_of_the_liberals_10.php). Of course, it isn’t as if either host plucked them from the blogosphere. No, I submitted them. But they were accepted, which is nice. And I’m not here to crow, not even about the tiny just-above-background-noise spike in my traffic. I’m here to say that these blog carnivals, which I’ve only recently started paying attention to, are a jolly good way of finding new voices worth listening to. If you feel the same, and I am one of those voices for you, please consider yourself welcome.
