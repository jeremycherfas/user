An entirely new page which, I hope, celebrates the end of stage one of the rebirth of this site.

But there does seem to be a teeny problem ...

... Now apparently solved. I made a totally nOOb mistake, updating the remote site _via_ the remote dashboard, which changes borked the automated git stuff that synchronises everything up. Maybe there's a way to have github pull those changes from the remote server, when necessary. Or maybe I should stop trying to be so bleeding clever and just remember not to attempt to do anything in the production environment.

I guess I could also clean out the old_user stuff that I created to get to this point.
