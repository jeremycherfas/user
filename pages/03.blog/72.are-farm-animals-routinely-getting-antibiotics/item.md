Yesterday brought a tweet with an interesting angle on a scientific development. Accompanied by a herd of [stockphoto cows](https://tineye.com/search/69e2fa6270890da85a98b44a93abe467a6a310e3/?extension_ver=), John Blue of Truffle Media [tweeted](https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826782663017111552)

> "CRISPR-Cas9 used to create genetically Tuberculosis-resistant cows could be 1st #antibiotic free livestock"

Killjoy that I am, I [replied](https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/826790908943331328):

> "I reckon they'll still get antibiotics to promote growth."

John Blue [reminded me](https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826950500629303301) that US FDA regulations now say that

> "Antibiotics cannot be used for production, e.g., growth promotion, purposes"

I first [asked](https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/827044645720956928)

> "Is the use of antibiotics for production now zero?"

And then, after getting a link as a reply, asked again, quoting the bit of the article he linked to, which said that ""the use of antibiotics for growth promotion be halted by 2016"

John's [answer](https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/826950849238810624)

> "If you want to interview someone   about #antibiotics in #ag let me know"

Nothing if not a pain in the arse, I [asked again](https://twitter.com/EatPodcast/status/827441962621997056)

> "So, routine use in production is now zero?"

John [replied](https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/827197024978268161)

> "Sick animals can still receive proper veterinary care via judicious use of #antibiotics"

Which is nice, and all, but. Today brought [another reply](https://twitter.com/TruffleMedia/status/827492835075223553) to the same question.

> "@EatPodcast to help, can you clear up what you mean by "routine use" & #antibiotics? If you'd like, I'll connect you w/ a veterinary expert"

At which point I think I'll just shut up. And it seemed such a simple question.
