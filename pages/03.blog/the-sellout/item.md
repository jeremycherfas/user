The internet makes it all too easy to go hunting for the information that will make sense of a book or an author, and I am resolved not to do that. At least, not till I have finished this review. From that position of self-imposed ignorance, <em>The Sellout</em> is a brilliantly funny and cutting satire on race in America. Nothing is safe, no-one immune, no taboo out of bounds. Sex, music, drugs, intellectualism, passivity, crime. ...

===

*What are you rebelling against?*

*Whadda you got?*

At one level, then, I loved _The Sellout_ for its energy, abrasive wit and the sheer joy of reading sentence after sentence that covers half a page or more and takes no prisoners. At another, though, it is very weird indeed. 

A mostly black, mostly agricultural city, loses its identity by being subsumed within the city of Los Angeles. And the sellout in question, the narrator, hatches a scheme to resurrect the city and, in so doing, to resurrect the residents' pride. The scheme is to reintroduce segregation and even, to some extent, slavery. The thing that made it such entertaining reading, quite apart from the muscularity of the prose, is that it says all these unsayable things. And then comes the guilt. 

*Should I be laughing?*  
*Well sure, that's what the author intended, plain as day.*  
*Yes, OK. But I suppose I ought to also be thinking more deeply about some of the issues raised.*  
*If you must. But hey, it's only a book.*

All of which is why I honestly have not looked up anything at all about Paul Beattie. I'm just going to assume, for now, that he's allowed to say the things he does because of who he is. And if he isn't who (or what) I'm blithely assuming he is, then what? Could someone else have done the same?

There's one passage in the book that sums it all up: This one:

> After two hours of sitting in the dark laughing at unmitigated racism, in the brightness the guilt sets in. Everyone can see your face, and you feel like your mother caught you masturbating.

Which is precisely how it feels reading _The Sellout_. Hilarity and mirth, followed by hyperconscious self-doubt. I thought of Nigella Lawson's take on what less aware people call guilty pleasures: 

> If you're feeling guilty, it isn't a pleasure.

And I resolved to just continue having a good time, at least until I needed glasses.

And finally, having done the research I stopped myself from doing at the start, I know that Paul Beatty is someone I will want to read more of in future.

As a footnote, I really want to understand the role of agriculture in the lives of Paul Beatty and his creation. The Sellout grows the most amazing stuff; weed, fruit, vegetables all of which can work miracles. The follow-up has to be a how-to for the urban farmer.

    Now, if I had my druthers, I couldn’t care less about being black. To this day, when the census form arrives in the mail, under the “RACE” question I check the box marked “Some other race” and proudly write in “Californian.” Of course, two months later, a census worker shows up at my door, takes one look at me, and says, “You foul nigger. As a black man, what do you have to say for yourself?”

    He and the rest of the non-Dickensian flock belonged to that scary subset of black lycanthropic thinkers I like to refer to as “wereniggers.” By day, wereniggers are erudite and urbane, but with every lunar cycle, fiscal quarter, and tenure review their hackles rise, and they slip into their floor-length fur coats and mink stoles, grow fangs, and schlep down from their ivory towers and corporate boardrooms to prowl the inner cities, so that they can howl at the full moon over drinks and mediocre blues music. Now that his fame, if not his fortune, has waned, werenigger Foy Cheshire’s foggy ghetto moor of choice is Dickens. Normally I try to avoid wereniggers at all costs.

    [I]t’s “survival of the witless,” and we’re the black moths in that classic evolution photo, clinging to the dark, soot-covered tree, invisible to our predators and yet somehow still vulnerable. The job of the swarthy moth is to keep the white moth occupied. Glued to the tree with bad poetry, jazz, and corny stand-up routines about the difference between white moths and black moths. “Why do white moths always be flying toward lights, slamming into screen doors, and shit? You never see black moths do that. Stupid fluttering motherfuckers.” Anything to keep the white moth next to us and thereby reducing our chances of being targets for birds of prey, the volunteer army, or Cirque de Soleil.

    The fellows at the gas station were still playing chess, the attendant’s cursor hovering hesitatingly over a cornered piece as if his next decision decided the fate of the world. The attendant slammed a knight onto a square. “You ain’t fooling nobody with that Sicilian gambit chicanery. Your diagonals is vulnerable as shit.”

    I’m a farmer, and farmers are natural segregationists. We separate the wheat from the chaff. I’m not Rudolf Hess, P. W. Botha, Capitol Records, or present-day U.S. of A. Those motherfuckers segregate because they want to hold on to power. I’m a farmer: we segregate in an effort to give every tree, every plant, every poor Mexican, every poor nigger, a chance for equal access to sunlight and water; we make sure every living organism has room to breathe.

|   “I just want you to know I’m fucking Bonbon.” Oblivious to the thorns, Panache stuck what remained of the pineapple, skin and all, into his mouth, slurping and sucking out every last drop of juice. When the fruit was dry as a desert bone, he walked up to me, tapped my chest with the tip of Lulu Belle’s barrel, and said, “Shit, if I could get some of this pineapple every morning, I’d fuck the nigger, too.”|   I'm hoping the sequel is a how-to breeding and gardening guide.|

    A long time ago, my father taught me that whenever you see a question on the cover of a news magazine, the answer is always “No,” because the editorial staff knows that questions with “Yes” answers would, like graphic cigarette warnings and close-ups of pus-oozing genitalia that tend not to deter but encourage smoking and unsafe sex, scare the reader off.

    Most folks think “We Shall Overcome” is still in the public domain. That through the generosity of the black struggle, its empowering refrains are free to be sung by anyone anytime one feels the stings of injustice and betrayal, which is how it should be. But if you stood outside the U.S. Copyright Office and protested people profiting from a stolen song by singing “We Shall Overcome,” you’d owe the estate of Pete Seeger a nickel for every rendition.
