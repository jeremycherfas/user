> Francis Crick, who died on 28 July at the age of 88, was trained as a physicist but became arguably the most influential biologist of the twentieth century. His great curiosity was coupled to highly original thinking; through force of intellect he obtained answers to many fundamental problems. In seminars he often demanded clarity from speakers, thereby generating some tension. However, he had a lively sense of humour, sharp but never malicious. Crick had no PhD students and only a rare postdoctoral fellow, but nonetheless often worked closely with a collaborator. Above all, he was a very kind and considerate person. 

I remember one afternoon in the zoology department cafeteria ... but then, who wouldn't. It isn't every day a Living God buys you a teacake.
