Inexplicably, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and John Prine turned up in my Shared Downloads folder doing You Are My Sunshine.

![Here is the audio](john-prine-johny-cash-bob-dylan-you-are-my-sunshine.mp3).

Neato-burrito. And if that doesn’t improve your day, nothing will. But although I searched in all the usual places I couldn’t find anything about the recording. It just doesn’t exist. Well, last.fm refers to a version without Prine, but doesn’t have it and can’t play it.

Someone must know more.
