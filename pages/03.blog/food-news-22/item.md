Start: 95.4 Last week: 87.4 This week: ??.?  
**Wednesday 6 December:** Away in the land of the super-size portion, where a side salad could feed a family of four (rabbits) for a week, and it is a good thing I don't have a set of scales to scare me. There is just so much food, so readily accessible that it is a wonder there aren't even more obese people around. I'm trying to moderate my intake -- and hotel breakfast at $17 a pop makes it easy -- but probably not doing as well as I need to.
