... [I told you so](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/work/nothing-new).

Well, well, well. [First documented case of pest resistance to biotech cotton](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/681670).[^fn1]

> The researchers write in their report that Bt cotton and Bt corn have been grown on more than 162 million hectares (400 million acres) worldwide since 1996, “generating one of the largest selections for insect resistance ever known.”

Even so, the researchers found that most caterpillar pests of cotton and corn remained susceptible to Bt crops.

> “The resistance occurred in one particular pest in one part of the U.S.,” Tabashnik said. “The other major pests attacking Bt crops have not evolved resistance. And even most bollworm populations have not evolved resistance.”  
> The field outcomes refute some experts’ worst-case scenarios that predicted pests would become resistant to Bt crops in as few as three years, he said. 

So, that's alright then. [^fn1]
