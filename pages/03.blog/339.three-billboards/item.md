The (Italian) poster for _Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri_ describes it as a black comedy. I'm not sure I would call it a comedy of any kind, even though it has lots of very funny moments. But then, I'm not sure what category I would put it in, if forced. "Quirky, damn funny, thought-provoking" isn't actually a thing, I don't think. But it could apply equally to _In Bruges_, also by Martin McDonagh, so maybe it is a thing after all. The entire cast plays brilliantly and it would be invidious to single out anyone in particular. Truly fine.
