[![Participant in a very large public pillow fight in San Francisco](1561999384-c2623a6800-m.jpg){.left}](http://flickr.com/photos/philippeleroyer/1561999384/) Of course. Who hasn’t? But I cannot remember a specific fight. And until this very moment -- searching Flickr for a picture -- I had no idea that big public pillow fights took place, at least in [San Francisco](http://sanfrancisco.about.com/b/2008/02/11/the-great-san-francisco-pillow-fight.htm) and Paris. I suppose it is all good clean fun, except for the feathers. I did a little bit of research, but aside from the fact of the events, there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot of explanation. You can [watch a video] ~~http://dailymotion.alice.it/video/188966~~.[^1] I did, for a few seconds. And you can see [a great photo of the Beatles](https://www.holdenluntz.com/artists/harry-benson/the-beatles-pillow-fight-paris-1964/), pioneers in this, as in other things.
