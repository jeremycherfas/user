I am developing an unhealthy obsession with nuns. After all, in the end theyâ€™re probably more or less normal people, with the same hopes, fears, ambitions etc. as the rest of us. But I still find it noteworthy when I see them doing more or less normal things. Like using laptop computers. And wearing groovy Birkenstocks.
