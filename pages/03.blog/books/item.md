I learned two things from Aaron Swartz’s [2010 Review of Books](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/books2010).

1. The guy can read.
2. I can make use of that; five books added to my wishlist.[^1]
 
OK, so that’s barely more than 4% of the stack he got through, but I’m not competing. And I should maybe try and do some more reviews myself, as a brain-dump as much as anything.

[^1]: 2022-01-04: Not one of which I read. I need to fix that, even eleven years on.
