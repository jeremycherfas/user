Well, who’d a thought it? Other people have [issues with Microsoft](http://jeremycherfas.net/blog/too-good-to-be-true/) too. Communicatrix -- a new one on me but one clearly worth watching -- has been letting off some serious steam. “Dear Microsoft,” [she writes](https://web.archive.org/web/20090106025544/http://www.communicatrix.com/2006/01/color_me_open_s/), “go fuck yourself.” 

It’s a promising start, that’s for sure.
