Episode summary: It’s our fifth birthday, Citizens and we’re excited to celebrate with all of you. Birthday donuts, anyone? This month, we asked the Radiotopians about what they would do for their dream birthday celebrations. You’ll hear: Nate DiMeo, Nikki Silva, Ian Chillag, Helen Zaltzman, Benjamen Walker, Davia Nelson, Joe Richman, Phoebe Judge, Lauren Spohrer, Jonathan Mitchell, Roman Mars, and Jen Poyant. Citizens, we have to know…what is the perfect Radiotopia birthday cake (or donut) flavor? Head over to the Radiotopia Citizens Facebook Group and let us know or share your favorite Radiotopia story or memory. #RadiotopiaTurns5 on Twitter. Cheers!
