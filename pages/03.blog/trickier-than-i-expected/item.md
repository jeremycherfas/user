It really is like learning to type and operate a mouse all over again. Sat at the dining room table, connected to the office iMac _via_ RealVNC on the iPad, with a magic keyboard and a magic mouse, and I keep making incredibly stupid mistakes. It is weird, as if sometimes more complicated commands, like ⌘s, get sent just fine and at others they don’t get though at all. The repurposed hyperkey definitely does not function, but maybe I can do the same by double tapping, and thus locking, the four keys I need: Apparently not.

Still, this post is being composed entirely remotely, and it seems to be going alright. I think something happens whereby when I have been typing for a little while on the outboard keyboard, control passes entirely to it and all the touch screen stuff no longer matters.

I’m going to crack this, somehow.
