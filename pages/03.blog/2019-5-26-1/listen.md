Episode summary: By 1976, college student Jeff Daniels was pretty sure he didn’t want to follow his father into the Michigan lumber trade. But he wasn’t sure he could make it as a working actor — until one of the founders of Manhattan’s legendary Circle Repertory Company spotted him at Eastern Michigan University. It was a short hop from Circle Rep to his screen breakthrough in Terms of Endearment, but Daniels’ commitment to the stage has never waned. That commitment bore a Tony nomination this year (Daniels’ third) for his magnificent performance in Aaron Sorkin’s To Kill a Mockingbird adaptation on Broadway. Daniels and Alec discuss the craft required to play Atticus Finch, the very different craft required to play alongside Jim Carrey in Dumb & Dumber, and Daniels’ unusual decision to move back to his Michigan hometown with his wife and child while building a Hollywood career.
