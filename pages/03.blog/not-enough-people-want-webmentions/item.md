A little while ago (on 19 October, to be precise) someone mentioned <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://commento.io/" >commento.io</a >, an open source commenting system for websites. It looked interesting, so I tried to leave a comment on <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://kevq.uk/commento-the-privacy-respecting-commenting-system" >the post that mentioned it</a >. Despite a few problems with login, I managed it, and asked whether Commento could play nicely with webmentions. No reply there, but I also took the matter up with support at Commento.

Today I got a reply. It didn't really address the login point, but did speak to Webmentions:

> A few people have mentioned WebMentions, but unfortunately I don't have the time resources to build that feature as the feature requests does not have enough volume (I prioritise features in the descending order of number of requests).

Is this a clear case of people not wanting what they don't know about? Or is it, rather,st a classic opportunity to say if-you-build-it-they-will-come?

Anyway, if number of requests is what it takes, I've [added mine](https://gitlab.com/commento/commento/issues/40) and urge anyone who feels similarly to do the same.
