In survey after survey, English shoppers say they trust supermarkets to deliver high quality produce. [Fools](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/26/themonarchy.supermarkets). They just aren’t equipped to do so.

> Organic carrots bought recently at Waitrose carry a picture of Peter Cornish, one of its “carefully selected growers”, on the back of the pack, but in small print on the front the carrots’ country of origin is listed as Italy. A bag of parsnips with the story on the back of organic English parsnips as grown by Andrew Nottage, who has won community awards for biodiversity, is sourced in Scotland. The story of watercress grown by the sparkling chalk streams of Hampshire accompanies a product imported from Portugal.
