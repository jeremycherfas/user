As I work on my new theme for this site, I noticed again that the old theme's way of dealing with the webmentions I send is not 100 per cent functional. Specifically, quite a few sites seem not to like the h-card here, which is present on every post as a `<div>` that contains pure `<data>` elements.

===

Having just read, then, that Stephen Rushe has <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/10/16/134737/" >a new implementation of the Authorship algorithm</a >, it seems only right to send him a webmention.
