![Coriandoli](coriandoli.png){.center}

_Confetti_, in Italian, are the sugared almonds given to guests, traditionally at a wedding, when the sugar coating is white, and now extended to pink or blue at a baptism and red at a university graduation. "A quando i confetti" is apparently a cute way of asking when one is going to get married. Given that they are rather hard, one understandably does not throw _confetti_ at a wedding. One throws rice. 

And then it gets tricky. Because Italians **do** throw little bits of coloured paper, but during Carnival and New Year's, rather than at newlyweds.

I guess that _confetti_ derives somehow or another from _confezione_, a package (of sugared almonds) or confection. Trying to find the meaning of coriander, though, is more difficult. Neither of my two little reference books has it, and I don't have a copy of Stearn's Botanical Latin. Most places just say it is derived from some ancient version of the word coriander. Eventually, I found the [botanary, at Dave's Garden](http://davesgarden.com/guides/botanary/), which says that it is: "From the Greek koris, a bug or gnat; referring to its aroma". That's better, although the logical positivist in me would love to know which bug or gnat, so I could try a sniff test.

Questions remain:   
	
* Why are _coriandoli_ so called? Were coriander seeds ever thrown during celebrations?
* How did Italian almond _confetti_ get transformed into English paper confetti?

Over to you, internets.
