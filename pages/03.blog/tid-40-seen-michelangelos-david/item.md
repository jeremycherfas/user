For the first time on the same trip that I first saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Since then, not as often. It is pretty impressive, though, that I would have to admit. However, I’m going to hijack the intent of this TID entirely and say that awesome though Michelangelo’s David may be, by some standards, it can't hold a candle to [Donatello’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Donatello)) glorious version of the same. Of all the classic Davids, the Donatello is the one I’d want in my living room, even if that room were large enough to hold Michelangelo’s, even if it isn’t actually David.
