Taking advantage of the downtime to continue migrating old blog posts, I'm mostly conscious that nobody except me cares whether most of these pieces endure. Some I'm rejecting out of hand, as too ephemeral or unimportant to bother with. The bulk I just process. A few are worth drawing attention to once again.

I'd give exactly the same advice today to anyone who asked. But they don't.
