I've got a bunch of things that I want to write scribbled as notes but haven’t had the luxury of uninterrupted time to do something with them. But I also wanted to get something done, so I took the lazy route of appropriating a meme. [^fn1] I saw this one over at [Byzantium's Shores](http://byzantiumshores.blogspot.com/2008/12/have-you-ever.html), where Jaquandor did all the hard work of pulling it together. The idea is to **bold** all the things you’ve done; I’ve done a lot. And I’ve almost avoided the temptation to add parenthetical comments. If you’re interested, go ahead and ask.
