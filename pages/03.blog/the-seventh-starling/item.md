That Murmuration video is getting a lot of mileage as people marvel at the flocking behaviour of starlings. I liked the way grrrlscientist took the opportunity to kinda sorta explain [how starlings do it](https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/nov/08/1), even if the average reader is little wiser. OK, so they are tracking up to six of their nearest neighbours; now what? It did, however, serve to prompt a recollection of one of the first papers I remember reading on the subject, about flocking in dunlin. And that sent me scurrying to [YouTube, for this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZVbCC-gpxI). The great beauty of dunlin, of course, being that while they may not occupy space as effectively as starlings, they do have those white undersides.
