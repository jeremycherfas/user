First monthly of the new year means it is time to update all the things; colours and labels on graphs, lists of things I've watched, probably others.

===

## Highlights of the month:
- Bureaucratic Triumph in my wallet
- Tidied up here behind the scenes
- Visit to London to see my sainted mother
- Visit to Torquay to see my sainted sister in law
- Caught up with friends
- Caught a cold and still dealing with it
- Sewing!
- Crochet!
- Thought a bit on the 18th anniversary of my father's funeral
- Salted my lemons and limes
- Dipping a toe in Bluesky
- Submitted an episode to the Fortnum & Mason awards; pointless, but ...

### Stuff Done
Failed to streamline and simplify the whole donations business on ETP. Made a start to the redesign here, to be informed by the need to consider a dark mode design from the start, even though I don't personally like dark mode one bit.

#### Hours logged per month

Previous years are still on [an archive page](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/working-life).

### Goals

Nine posts. That's even better.

### Niggles

Still occasionally lose my grip on the things I need to get done, that super-annoying important and but not urgent quadrant.

### Final remarks

See above.
