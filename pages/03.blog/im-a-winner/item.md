Lotteries, raffles and the like are not generally my friends. But last night, I was lucky enough to win not one but [two Regency Wraps reusable parchment sheets](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/2012/02/08/parchment-love/), which unlike other reusable baking sheets can be cut to size. This happens so seldom I just had to share my good fortune. There will be a longish delay before I can report on whether they are as good as they’re cracked up to be, because I have to collect them from across the Atlantic, but I can wait. Can you?
