[Bastards](https://web.archive.org/web/20051119151936/http://www.humanflowerproject.com/index.php/weblog/iris_vandals/). Seriously, what exactly is the pleasure in destroying a flower bed?

The pleasure of [getting destroyed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/luigi_and_linda/sets/734017/), however, is something else again, as Luigi has witnessed. I wish I could find an ‘ethnographic’ post he sent me on the subject. God, but Google is amazing.
