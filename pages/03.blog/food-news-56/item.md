Start: 95.4 Last week: 88.3 This week: 87.2

**Tuesday 31 July:** I know it seems that I have neglected this particular blog element of late, but really that’s only to spare you, dear reader, from the same endless tedium I have to suffer weighing myself each morning. It just wasn’t dripping off any more. But, small mercy, it wasn’t piling back on either. Today, however, there is news. Prompted by an excellent talk at work last week, about Italy’s epidemic of obese babies, I decided I would revisit the BMI. Of course it is only a number, and of course that number is flawed, but when you need a number, there it is: 24.4.

I am officially no longer overweight.[^1]
