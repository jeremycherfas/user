I realize that the overlap between “people who read this blog” and “people who are members of the [Society for Conservation Biology](http://www.conbio.org/) and live in Europe” is probably exactly one. Just in case it isn’t, my web 2.0 savviness suggests that I make use of grassroots activism and the latest intertube technologies to enlist your help in my naked lust for power. Go and [read the candidate manifestos](http://euroconbio.blogspot.com/2008/10/candidates-for-board-member-2008.html), and vote for the person in the loudest shirt. Change. Yes we can. Etc. etc.
