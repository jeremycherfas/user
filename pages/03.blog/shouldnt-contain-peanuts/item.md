When I interviewed [Arun Kapil of Green Saffron for the podcast](https://eatthispodcast.com/spices), he casually mentioned “the very unfortunate cumin incident”. Even though I had never heard of such a thing, I didn’t pursue it at the time because it seemed too much of a diversion. In essence, someone, somewhere put peanut shells (and almond shells) in ground cumin (and ground paprika) not knowing (or caring?) that these allergens could hurt someone half a world away.

You can see why someone extolling the quality of their spices would be keen to distance themselves from tainted cumin.

I did some digging, and wrote up what I discovered in more detail over at [Eat This Podcast](https://www.eatthispodcast.com/digging-into-contaminated-cumin/).
