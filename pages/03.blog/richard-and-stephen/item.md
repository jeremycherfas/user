Run, don't walk, to watch [Richard Dawkins deal with Stephen Colbert](https://web.archive.org/web/20070321083732/http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2006/10/colbert_dawkins.html).

This is the second time I've seen Richard deal with a Stephen, and by far the funnier of the two. The other time the Stephen came off as pathetic. Indeed, scales fell from my eyes. (I must see if I can find the little thing I wrote about that, a while back.)

! 2021-10-18: I looked long and hard and could not find a link to the clip itself. YouTube told me it was unavailable. If you know better, tell me.
