The Main Squeeze had a slightly spooky moment when she opened her Instagram app this morning. Last night, she'd been noodling around looking for a holiday place to stay. Now, near the top of her stream, there was the exact same place she had spent most time looking at, in a "sponsored" post.

We had a little chat about [business models](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/instagram-s-algorithm), surveillance capitalism and the like, and I shared my dismay that [my preferred way of looking at photos](https://instagram-atom.appspot.com) from my Instagram friends -- strictly chronological, no ads -- was under siege as Instagram makes it harder and harder to use anything other than their own app and their algorithm. That may also make it more difficult to [repatriate the photos I post to Instagram](https://ownyourgram.com).

I've always said that I would pay for the kind of experience I want, but that alas this would be trivial compared to what Instagram makes from advertisers, based on nothing more than a gut feeling. So I went off to check on that feeling.

[Instagram Revenue and Usage Statistics 2018](http://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/) says that advertising revenue is set to reach $6.84 billion in 2018. [Instagram by the Numbers](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/) says that 800 million people use Instagram each month. I have no idea how reliable either number is, and I don't care. The simple conclusion is that each person would have to pay $8.55 a year to equal whatever Instagram gets a year from revenue. 

I would happily pay $12 a year for an ad-free, chronological timeline. And I know, for a fact, that advertisers are getting absolutely nothing of substance from me. 

Instagram **is** leaving money on the table.
