Where did the month go? I know it is a short month, but it was over so quickly. Still, there were trips to the beach and the cinema (Belfast) to remember.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- Negative Covid test on 2 February, no great consequences
- Merch samples arrived; quality is good and they are useful
- Satisfied with the podcast episodes this month, and entered Ostia Antica for the Fortnums awards
- Speaking of which, finally baked a panis quadratus for Fornacalia
- The weather has been sensational – warm and clear – but there is already talk of a bad drought this year
- Adopted a new approach to pork belly; very good
- We looked at houses in the country. Again.
- Booked a long-delayed trip to London
- Bought a new mixer and got it working, but it was a bad, hasty choice.

### Activities

Nothing particularly interesting. Continuing the notion of weekly blocks of time for key important-but-not-urgent categories of things to do, which definitely produces results. Continuing to work with my friend the artist, most of which consists of cleaning up his work so a computer can use it.

### Work

Some slightly tricky merry-go-rounds. A committee writes. I edit and re-write. The committee re-writes my rewrite. Rinse and repeat. Seven times!

### Goals

Only five new posts this month. I have notes on another four, but that's all they are; notes. Daily old posts numbered 79 for February. Some fun to be had there too, surfacing long forgotten stuff.

### Niggles

_After a burst of energy working with Python, I took things too easy and forgot a lot. This is definitely a tool that needs to be used to stay sharp._ Still too true.

### Final remarks

March will be busy, with a short trip and a long trip.
