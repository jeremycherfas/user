This whole "[sticky dough](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/confounded-bread/)" episode of late has been nagging at me. Then I remembered, I had this problem once before. But did I write about it? I did![^fn1] That time, I didnâ€™t think much more about it than plastic bag=condensation, because there were all sorts of other things going on with the dough. And the problem did not recur. But now that I think about it, I think condensation must be the problem. We shall see.

[^fn1]: See [It is risen again](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/it-is-risen-again/) -- my last post before migrating to WordPress, as it turns out -- and the preceding post.
