Episode summary: In his teens, “Gangsta for life” was the signature war-cry sung by one of George’s favourite singers - Mavado. But after Mavado’s epic clash with rival, Vybz Kartel, George saw the line as a mentality…one that had empowered and terrorised Jamaicans for decades. Music, money and murder all feature in this complex case study of Black urban street culture. Warning: This episode discusses adult themes and has some graphic descriptions of violence.
