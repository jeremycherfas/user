There's lots I can't write about recently; too bitter and twisted, too work oriented, too plain dull. So rather than dump my crap, I share some of the non-crap that's at least given me pause, and, indeed, elicited a wry smile if not an outright guffaw.

Obituaries are the new pornography, that's for sure. Two weeks in row, _The Economist_ has come up trumps, first with my dear old mucker [Jacques Derrida](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3308320) (but don't miss the [apology](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3352746), which maintained the same tone as the original) and then with the wonderfully hirsute [Veerappan](http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=3329040).  The beautiful thing about both pieces is how they manage to give a bad person a good send-off.

Speaking of send-offs (gosh, that was a neat segue) the best comment I've seen on the Kerry-Bush thang came from a Brit who finds himself (with good reason) in San Francisco. [Dunstan](https://web.archive.org/web/20041115175249/http://1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/11/04/final-thoughts-us-elections/) [^1] put the whole thing very well, something all the bleeding heart liberal pinkoes I sent it too agreed with.

There were others, but none as memorable.
