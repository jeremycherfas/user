I was going to post a link to this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdt3zIrNrXs) of John Martyn at Cropredy when I heard the sad news, but the truth is, it doesn't do anyone justice.

So listen to the version [John Martyn did with Levon Helm](https://soundcloud.com/brianedwardssf/john-martyn-rock-salt-nails) instead.

And as an aside, why does [Bob Dylan's similarly-paced version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ24oeIXYVg)[^fn1] sound merely plodding, while Martyn and Helm manage to make it sound, oh, I don't know, majestic?

[^fn1]: I’m not sure Levon was even there; he is certainly not much in evidence if he was. [He wasn’t](http://theband.hiof.no/articles/the_ties_that_bind.html).
