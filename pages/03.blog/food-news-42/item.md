Start: 95.4 Last week: 89.7 This week: 88.8  
**Tuesday 24 April:** skipped a week, numerically, because although I did weigh myself I didnâ€™t want to crash in on the Moroccan narrative. Still hovering around the same old figures, which is not surprising as I have been eating enough. No sense of deprivation at all, so I wonder whether I just need to give myself some sort of kick -- a week of miso soup for lunch, perhaps -- to get moving again.
