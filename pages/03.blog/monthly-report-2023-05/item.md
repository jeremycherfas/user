Appalling. Over halfway through this month before summarising last month, and I was sorely tempted to just abandon a report for May. I know what that would do to me, eventually. In any case, I have excuses, two week-long trips, one in May, and one the first week in June.

===

## Highlights of the month:

- Continued to fix up the old Raleigh
- Teeth cleaned (mine, not the bike's)
- A week in Tunisia, unblogged and uncatalogued
- Rode a camel to see bread being baked in desert sand
- Taxes submitted
- Walking tour of the Rome Ghetto; fascinating
- Abandoned my previous monitor speakers and bought a new pair
- Watering system needed only a new battery to function again
- Baby figs!

### Stuff Done

On the bike restoration, there has to be a word that is considerably less than restoration but considerably more than greasing up the chain. Fixing up doesn't seem to quite do it. Anyway, I scored a quill stem and a saddle on eBay, though the saddle has not yet arrived. Sniper worked beautifully. The mismatched crank thing is weird too, because I found other pairs of mismatched cranks on eBay that, the sellers said, was just how they found them. Only the frame left now, but I seem to be procrastinating more than usual. Fear of failure, almost certainly, as I have never done anything like this. Of course I blame the wind, because I have to spray outside, but the basic problem is fear, no matter how many YouTubes I watch.

### Goals

Ten posts here, which is good, even though `$project` continued to be ignored. Trying to put Keyboard Maestro to more use, but the climb is steep.

### Niggles

None?

### Final remarks

Portable computing needs to be raised a notch. We will be on the road quite a bit this summer and I want to be able to keep up with things and, indeed, develop new things. So I need to mirror a bunch of things to the laptop and do it in good time.
