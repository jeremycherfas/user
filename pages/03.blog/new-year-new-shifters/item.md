Arrived at our holiday destination to find a package that I have been longing for, although I will just have to delay gratification a little longer. A pair of Silver shifters from Rivendell. Totally unnecessary, a complete indulgence. The plastic Shimano shifters on the Raleigh work perfectly well, but these aluminium shifters are in another orbit entirely. Simply beautiful, which is as good a criterion as any, once function has been taken ito account. (Photos when I’ve mounted them, although being in a little baggy does nothing to diminish their appeal.)

It also pleases me to read, as I did in the latest Rivendell newsletter, that they “sell one in every 20,000 new bicycles sold in America”. That’s the kind of place it pleases me, in my infinitesimal way, to support. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to be able to buy an entire Rivendell bicycle for myself, but that is unlikely ever to happen.
