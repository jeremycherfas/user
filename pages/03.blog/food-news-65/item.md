Start: 95.4 Last week: ??.? This week: 89.5

**Thursday 4 October:** Pleasantly surprised this morning after getting on the scales for the first time in three weeks. I’ve been eating three meals a day for the past two weeks, and I thought it would show more. But maybe that’s the unfamiliar foods effect kicking in. Anyhow, no matter, this feels fine and under control. The funny thing about not doing the oil was the return of breakfast, with a vengeance. For the first couple of days I got by on a couple of pieces of fruit. Then slices of cake and muffin added themselves mysteriously to my plate. Finally I was on a bowl of cereal plus fruit plus muffin plus sometimes savouries. Because it was there.
