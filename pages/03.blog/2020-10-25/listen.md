Episode summary: In the mid-1800s, Harvard Medical School had a reputation for being a “den of body snatchers.” And then, in November 1849, the school’s most prominent supporter went missing. He was last seen walking into the medical school building. Paul Collins’ book is Blood & Ivy: The 1849 Murder That Scandalized Harvard. Criminal is a proud member of Radiotopia from PRX.
