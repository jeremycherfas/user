Pharyngula has unearthed a nice little creationist rip-off, this time by The Other Side.


> Lying, stealing, and misrepresentation are common creationist values, I guess — Allah must endorse theft. They have no intellectual merit that they can contribute, so they have to resort to pilfering from evolutionists. Although, maybe we can justify it by comparing it to a starving man stealing a loaf of bread: creationists are so scientifically impoverished that they have to steal data. Does Shari’a accept that excuse, or is poor Harun Yahya going to have to get a hand lopped off?

I’m not going to give the Living Fossils site, which is what PZ is talking about, the benefit of a link. Go [read the whole thing](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622070321/https://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/creationist_amorality.php).
