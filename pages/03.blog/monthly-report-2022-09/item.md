The best news, in a way, is that summer is very definitely over. We have enjoyed some excellent rain, both thunderous downpours and more gentle soaks and the park is greening up nicely as a result. It is still warm though, so the terrace plants are doing really well. Launched the new season of Eat This Podcast to an uptick in downloads but a downturn in subscribers. Truly, I have no idea what makes sense any more, so I'll just keep plodding along.

## Highlights of the months:

- Swam 1km almost every day while cat-sitting, and resolved to continue, but
- Had a suspect mole removed, which I then had to keep dry.
- I won't say QE2 dying was a highlight, but it was interesting.
- The giant blowsy hibiscus had a seedpod that contained seeds.
- Made some [lime pickle](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/homemade-lime-pickle).
- Shared my first public Alfred workflow, to [smartify quotes](https://github.com/jeremycherfas/alfred-smartify-quotes).
- Stonkingly good six-course tasting menu at a swanky hotel, a parting gift from The Squeeze's colleagues.
- Excellent visit from one of my most durable friends.
- Created podcast music that sounds like â€¦ music!


### Activities

Managed to sustain reading and napping, and got some walking with sticks done into the bargain. I keep thinking about getting the Brompton tuned up again because the busses have been shite lately, but the old bike shop seems to have closed some time during the pandemic..

### Work

I did a bit. Had one offer turned down, because they wabnted it more urgently than I was able, and that felt absolutely fine.

#### Hours logged per month

### Goals

Only four new posts this month, but that's OK.

### Niggles

I sort of decided on a new MacBook Air, but I haven't actually done anything about it, which is stupid as I will be travelling quite a bit at the end of this month and beginning of next, so I need to time to get it organised.

### Final remarks

Life continues to be very good, although at times like this, when friends have passed through, I feel the lack a bit more than usual.
