It was fun today remembering my visit to China and a great time [visiting the hutongs on a bicycle tour](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/china-5). Checking the links, however, gave me a very odd surprise. The old URL of Chinese Culture Club, which organised the tour, is now being squatted. Nothing particularly odd in that. But it is being squatted in Hebrew. I was sufficiently intrigued to ask the machine to translate a couple of sentences and it seems to be be something to do with someone whose partner is obsessed by basketball.

But why? 

For the curious, the URL is http://www.chinesecultureclub.org/
