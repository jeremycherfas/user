At one time I hoped to be able to persuade people smarter than me to resurrect hosted domains for people to use WithKnown to blog. To that end, I bought the domain known.blog, which is now up for renewal. Again. By now I have mostly run out of hope, though not entirely. That is why I would be willing to transfer the domain to someone who would actually make use of it. Get in touch.
