The big difference between [Broadchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadchurch), ITV’s knockoff of [The Killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(Danish_TV_series)), and its model is that in the end, The Killing made sense whereas Broadchurch did not. 

They were similar enough as they rolled along. Everyone damaged to a greater or lesser extent, many hiding secrets nothing to do with the murder, and enough red herrings to sink a drifter. But when Vagn was nailed for The Killing you could look back and say to yourself, oh yeah, that bit when he said the other thing was a bit suspicious. I thought so at the time. By contrast, when Joe finally confessed, claiming he couldn’t stand the hiding any more, or some such twaddle, it was a huge let-down. So much so that we had to be flashed back to *59 days previously ...* for any kind of resolution. What a cop-out.

I’m not surprised that Wikipedia tells me few of the cast knew the identity of the murderer during filming. I’ve a hunch the writer didn’t either. A shoal of red herrings alone is not enough for a satisfying dish.
