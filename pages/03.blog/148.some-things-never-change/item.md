Yesterday I was walking down the street and I almost swooned under the influence of a tree full of orange blossoms. Today, I continue repopulating this website and discover that at around this time of the year, 14 years ago, [I almost swooned for the very same reason](http://Jeremycherfas.net/blog/special-orange-blossom). In fact, that day was very much like this in many ways.

> I nearly posted recently about the soul-sapping effort of writing for people whose goal in life seems to be to obfuscate rather than to communicate. And maybe I will one day soon, when I feel less bitter about the experience.

That's from [the same bout of repopulating](https://Jeremycherfas.net/blog/sad-and-neglected), and remains as true today as it was 14 years ago.
