I have no idea what happened in the last episode of The Sopranos.[^1] As far as I am concerned, Christopher’s girlfriend has just been befriended by her FBI agent. One day, surely, I’ll catch up. As I caught up with NPR’s Pop Culture podcasts, however, I was struck by just how much attention the question was receiving; two pieces before the episode in question aired. In one of them an expert on organized crime said that he thought Tony and his own FBI agent would walk off into the sunset together, that Tony would become a rat and sing.

And I wondered; could the writers possibly have planned all along that the series would be over when the fat soprano sang?
