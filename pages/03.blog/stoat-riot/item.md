Alas, Business 2.0 realised what it had done and made amends.

> Update, November 18: Business2.0 has graciously asked for permission to include the original linked image on their weblog, attributed – which permission, of course, I gladly granted. Sadly, they erased the numerous amusing comments about stoats that people posted to their comment board, but that comment board is theirs to do with as they please, and I have no say in the matter. (That said, whoever posted the comment "Stoat riot! Stoat riot! Stoat riot!" — if I ever start a band, it now has a name.)[^1]

That said, Paul Ford's [original post](http://www.ftrain.com/gooooooglebase.html) still contains all the gory details. I wonder if there's a cache somewhere of all the deleted comments?

[^1]: 2021-11-18: Huh? The quote, which I copied back in the day, is subtly different today. We are all allowed to edit our former selves.
