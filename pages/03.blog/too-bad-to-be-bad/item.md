OK, now I'm as much of a Darwin groupie as the next hominid, but I really don't think we need to dredge up a [long forgotten concept album](http://roughguidetoevolution.blogspot.com/2008/11/suzi-quatros-hey-charly-song-for-darwin.html)[^fn1] as a tribute to The Man's 200th birthday next year. I mean, I wish Mark Pallen luck, and all that, and I'm even happy to link to Suzy Quattro's[^fn2] Hey Charly. (_Lèse Majesté, moi?_) But really, it isn't very good, in my opinion, and probably was best forgotten.

So, whaddaya think? Glam, or Spam (a distinction stolen from [Deep Glamour](https://vpostrel.com/deep-glamour), a blog).
