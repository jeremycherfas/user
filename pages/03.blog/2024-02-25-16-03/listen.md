Episode summary: &ldquo;The police had surrounded the house. They had been there for quite a while. They didn&rsquo;t want to try to rush the house because they thought he might kill one of the innocent people. But after waiting for a long time, I asked the police: &lsquo;Let me see if I can talk to the guy.&rsquo;&rdquo; For decades, TV news reporter Russ Ewing stood beside more than 100 people &mdash; at their request &mdash; as they surrendered to the police.
