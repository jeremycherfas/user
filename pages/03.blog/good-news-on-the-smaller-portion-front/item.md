It was always a good joke to point out that Perrier was more expensive than petrol. [The joke just got better](https://www.foodpolitics.com/2010/02/the-real-cost-of-coke/). Coke in a small 7½ oz. can costs US$8.50 a US gallon and, better yet, 50-140% more per ounce than Coke in an old 12 oz. can. The full article is [here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-cokes-fizz-going-flat_b_446508). Money quote:

> You’ll save money by buying 12-ounce cans and pouring a third or more down the drain.

But of course, [nobody does that](http://jeremycherfas.net/blog/food-news-new-series-3-fat-taxes/). Just as nobody buys a large portion because it is cheaper per bite and doesn’t eat it all. Marion Nestle has this to add.

> I once asked a group of retailing executives why the cost of smaller size containers was so high (surely the containers don’t cost that much.  They said: “if customers want smaller portions they ought to be willing to pay for them.”  Oh.

Or, to put it another way, “Screw you, consumer.”
