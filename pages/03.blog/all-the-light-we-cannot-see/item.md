There isn’t much I can say about this luminous book that has not already been said by people far more accomplished than me. I found it a spell-binding read; the different points of view, the empathy for Marie-Laure and Werner, the timeline weaving back and forth, here and there.

How I came to read it is faintly amusing. When I have just finished a wonderful book, it takes me forever to decide what next because I am scared that anything I choose will be a disappointment. I raved about A Gentleman in Moscow to one of my best friends, and he said that he had read Towles’ previous book, All the Light We Cannot See. Of course, that is not Towles’ previous book. So what was it? Eventually we worked out that when he bought the Towles, Amazon showed him All The Light. He thought it was by the same author whereas it was actually people who liked that also liked this.

And they did.
