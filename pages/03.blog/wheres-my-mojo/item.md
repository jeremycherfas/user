_This post is number 47 in [a series](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/tag:50%20x%20100%20x%2050)._

When the world was young, best beloved, and floppy disks were great big things the size of saucers, I needed to count the words in a book. So I thought, well, what separates one word from another. Why, a space! And sometimes a carriage return! And so I wrote a little program in what we called Assembler, and it read each character in the book and counted the number of spaces, and the number of carriage returns, and it spat out a number, which I wrote down. But times moved on, and now I flounder, unable to do even the littlest thing.
