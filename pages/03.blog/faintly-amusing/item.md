! 2022-01-21: Iâ€™m bringing this post in absolutely untouched just to remind myself of the foolishness that once passed for erudition on the internet. Those A-listers? Every one of the links is dead.

A bunch of A-listers have created the blog equivalent of a circle jerk. In search of the best blonde joke ever you click on a link, say [this one](http://www.greghughes.net/rant/IllGoToHellForThisForSure.aspx). That sends you round the circle, [here](http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2006/01/12/im_so_going_to_hell_for_this.html). Still no payoff, but hey, [keep clicking](http://www.bit-shift.net/PermaLink,guid,eaeeca65-1e8c-44f7-9893-0f71d554c203.aspx). And [round again](http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/18/the-best-blonde-joke/). Eventually -- oh blessed cathartic relief -- you end up on a [blank page](http://www.greghughes.net/rant/IllGoToHellForThisForSure.aspx)!

Geddit?

Reminiscent of that old one, about how do you keep a ______________ (insert member of other community that you wish to denigrate here) amused for hours? Give him a piece of paper with P.T.O. written on both sides.

How we laughed.

Later ... turns out it wasn't the A-listers who did it. and it isn't a joke at all. It is a serious effort at internetworknodeanalysis. [Really](http://atrustheotaku.livejournal.com/318589.html)! I am SO out of the loop it hurts.
