[Stop Loss](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489281/) is a film about the war in Iraq and what it does to the young men who serve. War is hell. So is this film. How it gets the ratings it does is beyond me. IMDB says “Mark Richard estimated that there were no less than 65 drafts of the script.” Sixty five, no less? Fewer might have been better. Hard to say. When my copy stopped playing I wasn’t at all upset.
