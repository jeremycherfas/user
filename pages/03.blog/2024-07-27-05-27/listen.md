Episode summary: If you know and love the Vidalia onion&mdash;an onion sweet enough, its fans say, to eat like an apple&mdash;you likely also know it as a product of Georgia, as proudly claimed as the peach. But the story of the Vidalia&rsquo;s popularity is far more complex than just one of a local onion made good.
