It could have started a couple of days ago, but really, who has 12 days to celebrate, even something as wonderful as Fornacalia? In an effort to move things along [I've started](https://www.fornacalia.com/2018/gearing-up-for-fornacalia/) mixing up a batch of posts to culminate on 16 February with what I hope will be a massive tribute by and to bread bakers everywhere. [#fornacalia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fornacalia?src=hash) is where it will be happening.

I hope.
