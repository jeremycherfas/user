![My nose](My%20Nose.jpg)

Not that I am whinging or seeking sympathy or anything like that. But when one's nose is full of gauze, which nevertheless permits strange liquids to drip from it, one doesn't much feel like blogging. Still, I'm being well looked after by my Sainted Mother, who has arrived to make chicken soup in a strange land. I'm sure it is delicious, but unfortunately a nose full of gauze makes for a rather poor sense of taste. Perhaps there'll be leftovers tomorrow, when I am due to be unpacked.
