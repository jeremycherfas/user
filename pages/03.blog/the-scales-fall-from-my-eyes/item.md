I read this piece in the [New York Times, about the desirability of using weights, not volumes](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/dining/tipping-the-balance-for-kitchen-scales.html?_r=1&ref=dining)Â to measure ingredients when it first came out a month ago. And naturally ignored it; I mean, who needs to be told that? But today, when I went to print it out for some people who might need to be told just that, I discovered this perfect, perfect illustration of just why you should use weights, not volumes.

> Correction: September 28, 2011  
> The De Gustibus column on Sept. 14, about using scales to weigh recipe ingredients, misstated the weight of a cup of sugar. It is about 200 grams, not 225 grams.
