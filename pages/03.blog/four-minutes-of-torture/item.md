Really, how long does it take to hammer out a little review? Four minutes? Hahahaha; a private joke, because in the great catch-up effort, the movie in question is [Four Minutes](http://imdb.com/title/tt0461694/). This has everything. The artist as savage beast. Music as savage breast soother. Art as redemption. Sex. Violence. Lesbians. At one point The Squeeze leaned over and whispered, “They should have called it Four Hours”. But we stayed to the final, utterly predictable climax. So you don’t have to. 

My rating: 1 out of 5
