I am reliably informed that Sunday 11 February is [Evolution Sunday] ~~http://www.news-tribune.net/features/cnhinsfaith_story_033075710.html~~. Hundreds of churches will apparently mark the day with sermons and educational events dedicated to the idea that religion and science don’t have to be sworn enemies. Oh yes they do. Unless, of course, you like being incoherent, logically speaking. Mind you, the reliable source refers to “The Origin of the Species,” always a dead giveaway.
