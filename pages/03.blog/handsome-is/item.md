To the [Iota](http://www.iotaclubandcafe.com/) last night, an excellent joint in Arlington famous enough to have a mention in West Wing framed up on the wall.[^1] To hear the Handsome Family, a fine, weird combo that I was first introduced to by a friend who now lives in this very city. He wasn't there, but then I think he is "on mission". It is hard to describe the Handsome Family's genre. They perfectly understand the language of country music, the cadences, the harmonies, the structures. But they comepletely subvert the genre with their choice of subject matter; forests, road kill, extinction. Anyway, splendid.

[^1]: 2021-07-23: The site lives on, the joint, apparently, does not.
