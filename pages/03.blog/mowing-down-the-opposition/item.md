You can turn anything into a competitive endeavour, it seems, even the contemplative, mindful here-and-nowness of scything, [which I have long loved](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/nettles/). 

I miss my scythes (yes, plural).[^fn1]

(And in case you were wondering whatever happened to Nettle Awareness Week, it has apparently been relaunched as [Be Nice to Nettles Week](https://web.archive.org/web/20110829054306/http://nettles.org.uk/) and seems to be more or less [moribund](https://web.archive.org/web/20110514084459/http://workingwithwildlife.co.uk/).)

[^fn1]: And my orchard, but that's another story.
