Today is a bit of a geeky anniversary for me, which I would never had recognised had I not started trying to bring in [old posts written on this day](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/reading-a-day-at-a-time). Turns out that on 23 August 2004 I wrote my first piece using the WordPress CMS, while on 23 August 2006 I first published a piece of audio as a podcast. WordPress was not my first blogging engine. That honour goes to [NucleusCMS](http://nucleuscms.org/), which seems to have more lives than a cat (not that I'm going back to it). And I did subsequently learn more about podcast feeds and how to get them into Appleâ€™s podcast directory. It gives me some satisfaction to look back, not just on these posts, but on the many others I have updated over the past month or so, and not be utterly appalled by all of them.
