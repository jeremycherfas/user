_Update: There's an apology in the comments._

_2022-05-21: Another update: the comment is no more, but appreciated nevertheless._

This just in:

> I noticed your 50 x 100 x 50 is striking similar and also was started after another blog called 100x50 (https://lwarnerrose.wordpress.com/).

> I would like to say it was a coincidence...however in our increasingly interconnected world coincidence is beginning to become a thing of the past...at least in regards to the internet.

> Not to make accusations but is this similarity is a bit too similar, isn't it? Do tell...

> Saxon Baird

I’m above the kind of cheap shot that would have me sneer at syntax or grammar. I’m a man of substance, so I addressed the substance, thusly:

> Dear Saxon

> You’re kidding, right? Either that or all that experimental short fiction has robbed you entirely of your reason.

> Your first post -- oddly enough number 4, which seems pretty experimental too -- is dated 24th April. Neither that, nor your about page, gives any credit to anyone.

> My first post, dated 3 March, explains why I am doing this and the people who inspired me, with links no less.

> Your use of the internet to root out coincidence could do with a little improvement, I think.

> You (and Madeline?) can take your feeble insinuations and look in your mirror. In fact, I’m now wondering what inspired the pair of you.

> With all best wishes for your experiment.

> Jeremy

Now, dear reader, it’s over to you: what's your angle on Saxon?
