In 1977 my then wife and I went to Toronto. She had a real job and so, amazingly, did I, earning something unimaginable like $10,000 a year as a postdoc. We had plenty. And I think we were truly satisfied. But this is a silly topic, because every study I am aware of shows absolutely no link between having money and being satisfied (or happy, or content, or fulfilled). It just isnâ€™t a factor. Thirty-two years on, I know that fear of not having money is a source of worry, but having money is not a source of satisfaction.
