## “I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.”

The famed [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com) tagline is all very well but what if, even having written it down, you fail to remember it? Quasi-disaster ensues, if you’re me. As usual, the culprit is past me not paying enough attention to future me’s needs.

===

I had to ask someone a delicate question. I knew we had emailed in the past. I knew we had met at a conference. I knew the date and location of the conference, and that I had written down what we talked about. More than that, no recollection at all. Could I find the note? Of course not.

In the past, I have tried to fillet the good stuff out of daily notebooks, but not in a very organised fashion. Often, all I do is go through the old notebook as I start the next and transfer over things undone, or to keep, or to investigate, but I don’t even do that very regularly or thoroughly. So when I **need** to find something I know exists, I often cannot. I’m aware of the problem, which is why in the past I bookmarked [p1k3 :: notes on notes](https://p1k3.com/notes-on-notes/) and, especially, [My Notebook System](http://ratfactor.com/notes) by ratfactor, of which I am in total awe. But I haven’t done anything about it. In fact, I am so damn lame that although I date most notes, I don’t record the year.

So, yet another task that can only be accomplished in a little-and-often fashion, starting just as soon as I have published this.
