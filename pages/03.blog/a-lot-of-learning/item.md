> The problem is not that I am speaking from a position of ignorance. I am speaking from a position of knowledge to people who don’t know what knowledge would look like.

Read the whole of [Helen DeWitt's essay here](http://paperpools.blogspot.com/2007/08/cormac-mccarthy-semi-colon.html). And remind me to read something else by her. I really liked The Last Samurai.
