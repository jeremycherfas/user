The insoluble mystery -- is one home on the internet better than several -- continues to puzzle me. It came up in discussion on ADN, without any resolution. The reason I have several homes is that perhaps people who are interested in bread aren't interested in podcasts, and _vice versa_, while maybe people who come here aren't interested in either.

So a while ago I resolved to maintain those separate presences, and to use this place as the kind of mother ship, where I can do things that are neither bread nor podcasting and also briefly mention things I've done elsewhere. But I have also neglected to do that last thing. I am resolved to change that.

So, over at Fornacalia, there's [a recipe for a kalonji and raisin bread](http://www.fornacalia.com/2014/another-kalonji-bread-to-bump-me-out-of-my-rut/) that I invented last week to try and jounce me out of my current bread-baking rut. 

And at Eat This Podcast, a week ago I interviewed Colin Khoury about the [The Global Standard Diet](http://www.eatthispodcast.com/the-global-standard-diet/).

I've also changed what both those sites look like, with more or less success.
