Back from my travels with no worse to report than the expected upset tummy. While I was away -- without much in the way of connectivity, or time to use that which there was -- I thought it would be a cinch to fix the look of my pages. Three hours later, I know it isn’t. So I’ve lifted a good looking theme from Roobottom and may tinker with it to make it more personal. Or use it to understand why my original attempt is not working too well. There’s something wrong with the way it is picking up the stylesheet, but more than that I cannot yet figure.
