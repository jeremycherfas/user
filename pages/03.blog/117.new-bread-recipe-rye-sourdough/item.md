It took me four days to make a Swedish rye sourdough loaf, and half a day to write it up, but it was well worth it. My conclusion:

> This is a seriously good loaf. I sliced it upside down, as the top crust was a little brittle and I feared it would break up if I attempted to slice it normally. The crumb was dense but not heavy, moist and chewy, with enough rye bitterness and enough sourness too. Great with sweet jam and savoury cheese alike. A keeper.
