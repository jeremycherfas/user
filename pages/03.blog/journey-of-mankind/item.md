If, like me, you have been left a little confused by the explosion in studies of human migration based on inheritance of the Y chromosome, be prepared to be sorted out. The Bradshaw Foundation has a wonderful [animated map](https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/stephenoppenheimer/index.php) that shows the various migration routes, their timing, and what was happening on the global weather front. This was, for me, a really useful summary.

Thanks to Luigi for the link. There's some other good stuff on the [foundation's home page](https://www.bradshawfoundation.com/index.php), though I do wish it wouldn't click at me as I mouse over the tabs.

2022-07-27: The map is currently being updated, and the site is now called Journey of Humankind.
