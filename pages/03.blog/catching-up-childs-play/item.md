Catching up with my electronic “life” after a period of enforced non-connection used to worry me. Had I avoided infection by the latest viral fancy? Did one of my favourite sites feature something incredible, something I just had to share? What if someone had posted something really interesting to their blog? Worse, what if someone had been wrong, and I hadn’t been around to correct them? It took time, fostered guilt, frustrated me as new stuff came in before I’d finished dealing with the old.

Now, I just Mark All Read and start again. Stuff will find me, somehow, if it needs to.
