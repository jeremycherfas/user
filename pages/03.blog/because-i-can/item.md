The new WordPress has this nifty ability to embed Tweets, and this seems a worthwhile kind of article to test it on.

! 2022-06-15: Let this be a lesson to past me and all future yous. The Tweet has been deleted. Ferris Jabr is still tweeting, but his tweets live only as long as Twitter allows (or until he deletes them). That is why I no longer embed tweets and [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) whenever that makes sense.
