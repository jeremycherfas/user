Episode summary: The legendary violinist talks about his difficult childhood, stricken by polio in the war-torn early days of Israeli statehood â€” and laughs about his early success, whisked away to the United States at 13 to perform on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Later, his wife Toby Perlman weighs in, too, so the interview becomes a family affair, topped with a spectacular Mendelssohn performance by eight students from the Perlman Music Program. Toby founded that summer school on idyllic Shelter Island to provide a safe space for young musical geniuses to develop their talents, and themselves.
