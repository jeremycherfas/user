Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. Help support this show and the network that makes it possible by making a donation today. Make your mark at Radiotopia.fm/donate A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Music Philharmonics (Piano Sessions), from Agnes Obel. Pre-Barok by Mica Levi and Oliver Coates. Space in Between by Federico Albanese. Warm Canto by Mal Waldron. Blink by Hiroshi Yoshimura. Notes There are two lovely books I relied on heavily for this story: Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, Forgotten Designer by Julia Dockery Smith. And Rosemary Read’s The Threads of Time, Fabric of History.
