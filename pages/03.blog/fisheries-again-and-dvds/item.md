As if to prove [the point](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/fish-farmers/), there is a little piece about fisheries (un)management on cnews, a Canadian site, accusing British Columbia’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans of [caving to political pressure]~~http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Science/2007/06/26/4291752-sun.html~~ and allowing over-fishing. Of course one may not have all the facts, but by using the country’s Freedom of Information Act the [Watershed Watch Salmon Society](https://watershedwatch.ca/) gained access to emails within the DFO suggesting that department officials were not happy with the decision to extend the season. I wonder how many other similar cases would come to light if citizens had similar access to information -- and used it -- elsewhere?

And in unrelated (Canadian) news, when I visited that cnews site, I saw an advertisement for zip.ca, a netflix clone in that great country. There are 33 million Canadians, give or take, and 58 million in Italy. In Italy, people [apparently](https://watershedwatch.ca/) watch 14.9 hours of (execrable) TV a week, in Canada 14.7. So how come their DVD hire looks so much more interesting than ours?
