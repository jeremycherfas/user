!!! I am updating this post to remove one reason for its existence: I no longer wish to use the plugin that powered that slide-show. So this post is becoming a photo post with individual images.

Recently I came across a website called [The Eclectic Light Company](https://eclecticlight.co/), which is one of those places that you cannot believe you hadn’t visited before. I can’t remember who first linked to it, but it is catnip to me; geeky Mac stuff plus a wide appreciation of art and painting, it quickly won a place in my reader and I look forward to it daily.

===

All of which is by way of a throat-clearing justification for this post. 

Skipping through the archive, and what an archive it is, I came across <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://eclecticlight.co/2016/04/12/the-story-in-paintings-elihu-vedder/" >The Story in Paintings: Elihu Vedder</a > and recognised the featured image as one I had seen before, gazing down the main staircase in the Library of Congress. I had been absolutely captivated by the decor of the Thomas Jefferson Building when I visited, and took a fair few photos myself. That, and a sort of rennaissance of Flickr, prompted me to [look them out](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jcherfas/albums/72157700500028822) and share them there.

Much more to the point, [Howard Oakley](https://en.gravatar.com/hoakley) has assembled an astonishing resource, one that will keep me occupied for hours and hours and that has already prodded me to turn up the heat on a little project that has been on the back burner for longer than I care to remember.

Truly, the internet can be a place of wonders. As is the Library of Congress.

<figcaption style="font-style: italic;">Patriotism. Not sure why. Maybe the eagle she is feeding?</figcaption>

<figcaption style="font-style: italic;">The exhibit of maps did its best to tread warily on expropriation and dispossession.</figcaption>

<figcaption style="font-style: italic;">The exhibit obscured some things I wanted to see better, in more ways than one.</figcaption>
