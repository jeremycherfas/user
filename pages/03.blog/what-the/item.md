Handy blogging tip No. 381: Blocked? Check your stats!

Why on Earth was someone searching Yahoo for [free animal privets](https://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=sbc-web&tab=&p=free+animal+privets&btn=Search)?

And will this post now beat out the one result for “animal privets,” which seems to be a splog that I’m not going to bother linking to.

p.s. The searches for [guinea](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/parastatanoia/) [pig](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/whats-with-the-guineapigs) [images](https://jeremycherfas.net/blog/lunch/) just go on and on.
