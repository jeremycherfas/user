Sent by [ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/24/Billmon), I discover I may be the last person in the world to stumble into the [Whiskey Bar](https://web.archive.org/web/20050301011038/http://billmon.org/). An excellent read.

That makes it a new regular watering hole, at least for a while.

A little while later, [Rebecca](http://www.rebeccablood.net/index.html) sent me on over to [Geek Etiquette](https://web.archive.org/web/20050309024003/http://geeketiquette.infotrope.net/) and that looks like another keeper.
