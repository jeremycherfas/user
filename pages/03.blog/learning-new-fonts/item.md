Jeremy Keith (_aka_ Adactio) had a fun quiz on his website a couple of days ago. <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://adactio.com/journal/18830">Fonts or food?</a> offered up 25 chances to decide whether a word was the name of a font or a food. Challenge accepted, I scored 20/25. Two foods turned out to be fonts and three fonts turned out to be foods. A fine opportunity to learn things.

**Raksana** turned out to be a font. I'm not sure what kind of food I thought it was. Maybe something vaguely Indonesian. It was a guess, and a wrong ’un.

**Gentium** is also a font and, now that I've seen it a very handsome font it is too. I can see using it. I was probably thinking of it as some kind of *amaro* involving gentian flowers, although to be fair Jeremy would surely have classed that as a drink rather than a food.

Among the foods, for two at least I can see where I went wrong. 

**Mayhaw** is the fruit of a Crateagus species found in wetlands in the southern US. I knew of hawthorn, and that the haws are used to make jelly. And I knew that hawthorn is often called May, as in “Ne’er cast a clout …”. But I failed to put two and two together. That’s the mistake I feel worst about.

**Dabberlocks** doesn’t sound much like a font, to be sure. But to me it didn’t sound much like a food either. Turns out to be an edible seaweed. Fair enough, although two seaweeds in one list of unusual foods strikes me as one too many.

And finally, **tako** is the Japanese word for octopus. Nobody said anything about foreign words.
