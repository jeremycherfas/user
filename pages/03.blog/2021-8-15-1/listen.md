Episode summary: “The phone rang and rang and a lady picked up on the other end and I still remember the operator saying, ‘You have a collect call from Ian for Debbie. Will you accept the charges?’ And I remember Debbie saying, ‘Yes, I accept.’ And I just remember blurting out, ‘Ms. Baigrie, I just called to wish you and your family a merry Christmas and to apologize for shooting you.’” At 14 years old, Ian Manuel was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and spent an estimated 18 years in solitary confinement. Today, he tells his story. His book is My Time Will Come. You can listen to our full conversation with Bryan Stevenson in Episode 46: Just Mercy.
