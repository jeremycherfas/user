The crocuses have been out now for a couple of days here, as they have [elsewhere](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/02/08/Crocuses). These are not the big blowsy purple or yellow ones that make a bright carpet of colour. In fact, from a distance they’re nothing, one reason why I did not bother with a wide shot here. Get down on your knees in the moss and mould, though, and to my eye they are just as lovely as a big splash.

Other things are stirring too, possibly unsurprising given how warm it has been. But I heard today that the whole of Italy is now in a drought. Up north, it hasn’t rained for more than 60 days, and this is a Mediterranean climate, where the winters are supposed to be wet. The rest of the year could prove very difficult for all.
