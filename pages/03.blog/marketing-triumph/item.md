Golly it is hard to blog when you can’t connect to some of your favourite sites. First, the NYT. Now Wikipedia. I promise to add the links when I get back to the land of unfettered access.[^1]

When I was young, we didn't have English gooseberries (_Ribes uva-crispa_). We had Cape Gooseberries (_Physalis peruviana_) although it was not for another lifetime that I learned that not everybody called them that. And we had Chinese gooseberries (_Actinidia deliciosa_). Then along came a marketing genius and lo, the faintly suspect Chinese gooseberry (think Cold War Red Menace) stormed the USA and later Europe as the kiwi fruit.

So, guess what they call the hairy green things here? Yup. Kiwis.

Now I need to try an Indian gooseberry (_Emblica officinalis_ or _Phyllanthus emblica_)

[^1]: 2021-09-22: I didn’t. And _here_ was China, in case that isn't obvious from context.
