Thanks to [ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/29/TsunamiRelief) for pointing out that the simplest way to donate to help the tsunami victims was through Amazon.[^1]

Later ... When I visited the total was somewhere over US$3.7 million. It is currently (10.54 CEST 4 January 2005) US$$13,815,904.35. That is pretty astonishing. [Halley](https://halleyscomment.blogspot.com/2004/12/networked-economic-democracy.html) points to another little post at [buzzmachine](https://buzzmachine.com/2004/12/30/connected-charity-witness-the/) that examines the idea of online giving. Side note: Amazon raised US$6.8 million after September 11th. You do the math.

[^1] 2021-12-30: The link, not surprisingly, is long gone.
