Start: 95.4 Last week: 88.2 This week: 88.3  
**Tuesday 20 March:** Creeping down, just about. Something odd I’ve noticed for about a month now is that I’m often a bit peckish when I get home of an evening. Not ravenous or anything, but just in the mood for some peanuts or olives or dried apricots. Maybe that’s because lunches are pretty small these days. But I have to be a bit careful, especially if I am going out, because if I eat more than a few nuts I do feel full.
