I think it is important that women and girls get the best possible education. I think it is important that everyone get a good, nutritious diet. Education in a school garden? Good. Education for girls in a school garden? Better. Education that reaches beyond the school, “to provide food and ornamental gardens, while teaching about environmental stewardship and Marrakech‘s cultural heritage.” [Sign me up.](https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/gdf-benefit-moroccan-girls-school-garden/) You too?
