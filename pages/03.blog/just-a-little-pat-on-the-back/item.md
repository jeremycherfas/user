The pages here look very slightly different. Nothing major, mostly just changing the relative sizes of the different bits of text and trying to make things as legible as possible. CSS etc. is hard these days, and I have probably broken something. If you see anything that's either broken or ugly, feel free to [let me know *via* the contact form](/about).

I'd still like to find a new set of fonts, but that's a job for another month. Or year.
