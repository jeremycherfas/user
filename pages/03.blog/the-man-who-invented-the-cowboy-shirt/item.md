I do not apologize for saying, once again, that obituaries are the cutting edge of modern journalism. I get my best ones in The Economist, which has a knack for doing right by the sung and the unsung. Case in point: [Jack A. Weil](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/08/28/jack-weil), the man who puts snaps (press-studs), fancy yokes, pocket flaps and deep cuffs onto the western shirt and turned it into a fashion icon.

I’ll pay proper homage next time I’m in Denver and not dead.
