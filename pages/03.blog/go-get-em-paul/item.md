I had no real desire to add to the noise about Google’s new Google Base service, being as how I had nothing to add. But I’m delighted to point to Paul Ford’s latest over on ftrain, wherein he [sticks it to Business 2.0](https://ftrain.com/gooooooglebase.html), a publication of suspect ethics. In a nutshell: they stole his work, so he played them for the idiot suckers they are.

I just checked, and Paul’s work is still in place. The only shame is that he didn’t fix it so it links directly through to the page he is advertising.
