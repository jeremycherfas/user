One of the nicest things about a couple of days of break is the opportunity to get lost in a little project. Not entirely lost; after all, there are meals to be cooked and eaten, walks to be taken, relaxation to be enjoyed. Lost enough, though, to start and finish something, that something being the start of something I've been thinking of for a while, to make it easier to reach my two other sites from whichever site you happen to be on. 

I had lots of help, most notably from the rather wonderful [purecss site](http://purecss.io), which offers some beautifully simple ways of presenting stuff on web pages. Somewhat out of my depth, of course, but that's how you learn to swim.

One down, two to go.
