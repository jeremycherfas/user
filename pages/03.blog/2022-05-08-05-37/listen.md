Episode summary: There&rsquo;s one kind of expert whose role is enshrined in law: that of the expert witness, who&rsquo;s called on to bolster one side of a case. But courtrooms are not great places for nuance. Overconfident expert testimony has been linked to countless wrongful convictions, especially in gang-related cases. Michael speaks with a new kind of expert witness: former gang members who struggle to counteract the testimony of police.
