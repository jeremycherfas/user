Episode summary: When keeping it real goes&hellip;wrong? For a moment in the seventies, Jamaican democracy produced an ambitious plan to end inequality between countries. But when the island&rsquo;s socialist leader, Michael Manley, flew too close to the sun, he got burnt. What was the New International Economic Order? Why did it rattle Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan so much? On this fast-paced tour of Jamaican history, George looks back at the rise and fall of the Third World&rsquo;s biggest political project. Written by George the Poet Produced by Benbrick and George the Poet Original score composed by Benbrick and recorded by the BBC Concert Orchestra
