Episode summary: For the first time in more than 30 years, Michael Lewis has re-read Liar&rsquo;s Poker. That experience brought up a lot of questions &mdash; especially, why is a book set in the pre-Internet Wall Street of the 1980s still relevant today? So Michael turned to Jacob Goldstein, finance reporter and host of the Pushkin show &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Your Problem?&rdquo;. They discuss how Liar&rsquo;s Poker foreshadowed the ups and downs of the world we live in now.
