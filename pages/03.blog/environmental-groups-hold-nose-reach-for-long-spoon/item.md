Ok, so they ignored my request to investigate the cost of using [subsidized water to grow biofuel feedstocks] ~~http://www.ecorazzi.com/?p=1152~~, but I’m not bitter. The good folks over at [Environmental Economics](https://www.env-econ.net/2007/02/cant_we_all_jus.html) do a splendid bit of stiletto-work on who’s funding whom. Author Tim Haab says:

> I’m not saying one group is right or wrong here. I’m just asking--perhaps whining--for objectivity in the discussion. Maybe it’s time to move beyond the science equivalent of he said/she said and start asking “what do we do from here?”. The answer to that question is going to require cooperation from the public, industry, think tanks, governments, activists and academics (did I leave anybody out?). 

Have we ever been here before?
