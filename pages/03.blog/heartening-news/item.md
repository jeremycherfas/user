“My” Ugandan chicken farmer has repaid 8% of the loan she got from [Kiva]~~http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=businesses&action=about&id=33024~~.[^1] That’s not at all bad, given that the loan was disbursed less than a month ago. Of course, it would be nice to know a bit more about how Sylvia and the rest of her group are getting on, but they’re probably way too busy earning a living to be bothered with niceties like news.

[^1]: 2022-04-30: Dead, of course, one of the many reasons I gave up on Kiva and now [Give Directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) instead.
