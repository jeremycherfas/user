Today’s [rabbit quest](https://rabbit-rabbit.quest) offered an interesting and impossible challenge: smack dab in the middle of the Regina Coeli prison in Trastevere. I got as close as I could.

===

If I walked there I knew I would get a good overview of the prison and I did.

On the way down towards the river and the prison itself, I came across a very natty folding bicycle. Does a paint job like this really deter thieves? I imagine that’s what it is for. Probably the absent saddle is more effective. Not sure what cavallo paxxo means. Horse, yes, and Paxxo’s horse?

The number of seemingly derelict properties in Rome, needing only cash to turn them into something fabulous, always astonishes me. Often hidden behind crude gates, sometimes you get a peek inside.

Just before I got as close to the quest target as I could, I was struck by this sentry box on the other side of the road from the prison wall. You see these here and there around the city, although I've never investigated further. There are a couple of barracks around here, so maybe this was part of the peripheral security.

As for the quest itself, I got as close as I could.
