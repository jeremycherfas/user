Oh my! Someone called Erin has come out and said it: [I love dorks!](https://web.archive.org/web/20060705224002/http://erindowney.blogspot.com/2006/07/i-love-dorks.html) This has partially manifested itself in a “total girl-hard-on” for PZ over at Pharyngula, who is not that modest that he didn’t note it. As it happens I am not in the market, but if I were, I’d try to impress her with how much random stuff I know. Go on Erin, ask me anything.

And if PZ thought that one woman love-bombing him was enough to make him blush, wait till he discovers that [news@Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/442009a) has done a little survey and found he has the highest ranked science blog of all, 179th according to Technorati. (I feel so cheap reading it; so many others have been there too.)
