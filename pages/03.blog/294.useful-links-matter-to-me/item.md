We're all guilty sometimes of over linking to our own material, in the belief that this may affect our search engine rankings. The practice is really bad on some ad-farms and joke news sites, where some sort of automatic software creates a scattergun of links, often double underlined, [^fn1] that are generally useless. And, fortunately, easy enough to learn to ignore. 

===

Lately, though, I've become increasingly aware of some crazy link policy in an organ I have some respect for, and it is driving me nuts. I'm bringing it here, rather than the other place, because it is a meta-complaint; about the sources of information, rather than about the information itself. [Scidev.net](http://www.scidev.net/) - "News, views and information about science, technology and the developing world" - will have a paragraph like this:

> The institute, based in Lubumbashi, DRC, was established in 1979. But in recent years, countries have not been honouring their [funding](http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/finance/) pledges, citing economic difficulties, according to the DRC's agriculture minister, Norbert Basengezi Katintima.

Call me naive, but I expect that link for "funding" to take me to more detail of some aspect of funding, possibly even a story about how - gasp - countries have not been honouring their funding pledges. Likewise, I expect a hyperlink on research, in the paragraph below, to take me to more details of research, perhaps even on the specific problems mentioned.

> Now, ministers have agreed to recommence funding to enable the institute to carry out [research](http://www.scidev.net/en/science-and-innovation-policy/r-d-in-africa/) into crop and animal diseases affecting the region, such as cassava mosaic disease, banana bacterial wilt disease and Newcastle disease â€” a viral disease that affects poultry.

But no. [^fn2] Instead, each link takes me to a page of motley similarly-tagged snippets. This is plain dumb. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it actually decreased search engine rankings, quite apart from annoying at least one regular reader. [^3] I'd love to see the analytics for referrers to those bucket pages, and even more, a response from SciDev.net as to why they don't actually add some value to their stories by offering external links.

[^fn1]: Which is surprisingly hard to do. 

[^fn2]: Obviously, or I wouldn't be ranting.
 
[^3]:Who is, nevertheless, happy to link to those pages from here.
