Not much to see today, unless you go spelunking into old posts. If you do, however, you will notice that some of the older Reviews now are not quite as messy as they were.

The problem was that Kindle kindly formats the notes one saves with useful, descriptive CSS classes that I had left behind, so I needed to update the styling of those. No biggie, but it took time to get it looking just so. Even then, I decided to go with the existing classes and adapt my `custom.css`. As a result of which, the text is quite large on mobile devices. The smarter option would have been to edit the classes provided so as to include the additional information that Tailwind uses. Maybe that's a project for another day.
