My own personal Wayback Machine recently reminded me that as the first Covid lockdown got under way I [was forced](https://xkcd.com/386/) to address some prominent [myths about sourbread baking](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/guardian-influencer-distributes-misinformation) being promulgated.

All well and good. A columnist for hire must occasionally promulgate timely myths if they are to earn a crust.[^1] My myth-busting stands, but what intrigued me about my old post is the long back and forth that followed on Micro.blog. Two correspondents wanted more information about sourdough starters, which I was happy to provide. It got me wondering, had they continued to bake? 

Paul seems to have retired from MB a couple of years ago, though is still on Mastodon. I’ll tag him there and hope that he sees this. Stephen was still on MB as of a couple of months ago, and perhaps he too will respond.

As for me, my starters long predate the previous pandemic and will, I hope, survive the next.
