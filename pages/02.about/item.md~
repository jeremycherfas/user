I work as a freelance communicator. 

In essence, I see myself as a translator. I speak Science, and I speak English, and I work hard to make the two understand one another. 

I'll expand on this in coming weeks, but for now, <a href="mailto:jeremy@jeremycherfas.net">contact me</a> and let's see if we can come to some sort of arrangement.

Mostly, I like to help people tell their stories. I'm a biologist by training and by inclination, and my main joy is applying that to food and the agriculture and industries that supply it. I also have side interests in economics and many other things.

I don't currently have a portfolio, as such, but here are some of the things I've done:

* Quite a lot of my **written journalism** these days is for NPR'S The Salt, [most recently this piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/01/26/464437173/worlds-oldest-tea-discovered-in-an-ancient-chinese-emperors-tomb). I'm more than happy to consider any commissions.
* I make [Eat This Podcast]("http://eatthispodcast.com"), which was nominated last year for a James Beard Foundation award. I also make **podcasts** for clients and would be delighted to do the same for you.
* Several clients have asked me to work with them to develop a **communications strategy**. I can't say who they are, but they've generally been pretty pleased with the results and I'd be happy to talk privately.
* I've done a lot of **training on communications** and, especially, science writing. Again, more details on request.
* I'm proud of what Luigi and I have done at [The Agricultural Biodiversity Weblog](http://agro.biodiver.se/) speaking truth to power and generally snarking it up.
* I built this **website**, whatever its faults, and others.
