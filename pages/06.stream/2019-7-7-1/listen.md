Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. Music Duet for Ghosts by Ed Harcourt tops and tails this one. We here the top of Pomeriggio Zenzero from Paulo Conte. Some of Thankful by Bill Frissell. And Ingo Metzmacherâ€™s 6th Study for Player Piano Notes The most comprehensive thing I read on George Melendez Wright is from this supplementary piece to the Burns National Parks documentary, by Susan Shumaker.
