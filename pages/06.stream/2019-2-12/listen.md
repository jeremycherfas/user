Episode summary: Deep frying our food is a fast efficient way of cooking and it’s not new.The ancient Greeks staged comedies involving frying pans. The Romans fried fish in copious amounts of oil. But these days deep frying often gets a bad press. British chip shops compete to create ever more outrageous deep fried dishes. Deep fried chocolate orange anyone? American state fairs hold extreme deep frying competitions involving butter and cookies. And in the west of Scotland the ‘munchie box’ is a fearsome thing to behold. Rachel McCormack explores different cultures’ approach to deep frying asking why in Britain it’s often regarded as unhealthy and lower class, whilst in Italy and Spain fritto misto has its place in a balanced healthy diet.
