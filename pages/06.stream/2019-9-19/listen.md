Episode summary: The Memory Palace is a proud member of Radiotopia, a collective of independently owned and operated podcasts. A note on shownotes. In a perfect world, you go into each episode of the Memory Palace knowing nothing about what’s coming. It’s pretentious, sure, but that’s the intention. So, if you don’t want any spoilers or anything, you can click play without reading ahead. Anyway… Music We hear Vaggvisa by Henrik Lindstrand. Then Kestrel, off the album by the same name from Caoimhin O Raghallaigh. Ljuva mekaniska jag by 1900. A loop from When it’s Time to Go, by Buddy Fo & his Group. A bit of Movement II from Martynov, “Come in!” by Vladimir Martynov. Making Love in the Apartment from Krysztof Komeda’s score to Rosemary’s Baby. And the Mistral Noir, from Daniel Herkedal. Notes There’s a lot written about Kelly and his times, none more enjoyable than Bill Bryson’s in One Summer: America, 1927. The best academic book that touches on Kelly and his times is Dance Marathons: Performing American Culture in the 1920s…
