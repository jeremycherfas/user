Episode summary: The Anthropocene is the current geological age, in which human activity has profoundly shaped the planet and its biodiversity. On The Anthropocene Reviewed, John Green rates different facets of the human-centered planet on a five-star scale. This week 99% Invisible is featuring two episodes of The Anthropocene Reviewed in which John Green dissects: pennies, the Piggly Wiggly grocery store chain, a 17,000-year-old cave painting, and the Taco Bell breakfast menu. Plus, Roman talks with John about the show, sports, and all the things we love now, but hated as teenagers.

Absolutely golden episode (although I don't think I will be subscribing to The Anthropocene Reviewed, at least not as a podcast.) The interview was notable for two great things:

1. If Congress were drowning, it would be unable to pass a Throw Something That Floats to Congress Act (my paraphrase), and
2. A moth walks into a podiatrist, which is one of those great Zenish jokes that can be used in several contexts.
