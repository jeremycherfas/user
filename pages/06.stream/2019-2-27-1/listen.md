Episode summary: On the 80th Anniversary of the night 20,000 Americans attended a Nazi Rally in the heart of Manhattan, the Memory Palace is teaming up with Radio Diaries. Weâ€™ll hear their new story about that rally after we listen back to a Memory Palace episode that took place on that same evening, in which some Nazis get punched. Learn more about this evening at www.radiodiaries.org. For info on the original Memory Palace episode, head here.
