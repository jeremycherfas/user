Episode summary: The band Perta has landed a glossy magazine profile and is represented by star-making talent agents WME. They’ve got big labels knocking at the door, attracted by a stunningly talented frontman and a funky, catchy, original sound. But that doesn’t mean they can necessarily quit their day jobs. It’s a strange, exciting place to be. Perta frontman Mat Bazulka and founder/keyboardist Colin Kenrick tell the story of how one band is breaking through in a rapidly changing music world — and share some of the band’s unreleased tracks.
