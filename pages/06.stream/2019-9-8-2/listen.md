Episode summary: Here in its tenth year in operation, the Memory Palace just got a star turn in the wonderful podcast and radios show, Radiolab. We couldnâ€™t be more delighted. So, a word of welcome to new listeners and a call to arms for regular listeners and a story perfect for the end of summer.
