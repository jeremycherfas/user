Episode summary: In 2009, an old man died in a California nursing home. His obituary included not just his given name, but a long list of the pseudonyms heâ€™d been known to use. In this episode, we trace the life of Riley Shepard, a hillbilly musician, writer, small-time con man and, perhaps, a genius.

Another one from NPR in which, I'm afraid, the sound effects were just too [Lord Privy Seal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVlfvdH7qwY) for my taste. Great story though.
