Episode summary: I decided to start this podcast with my own story: as an overweight man, I explain how my shape and my diets often cause me to question my identity. This episode has been produced by me, Jonathan Zenti, and Story editor is Cathy Fitzgerald. I’ve also composed all the original music, and the title track is sung by my lovely radio mate Valentina Ziliani. A special thanks to all the friends who are in this piece: Helen Zaltzman and Eleanor Mcdowall, Mitra Kaboli, Leda Nano, Alberto Emiletti, Ilaria Dalle Donne, Beatrice Rappo, Giulia Nucci, Valentina Ziliani, Elena Sauro, Martina Copiello e Linda Gragnato. This episode was created for Radiotopia’s Podquest, by PRX, and made possible with funds from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

Really interesting listen, and challenging on so many levels. Subscribed, which seems the best thing to do given that the podcast is very sporadic.
