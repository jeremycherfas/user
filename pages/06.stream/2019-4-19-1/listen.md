Episode summary: Branding: Laurie Taylor explores the ‘persuasion industries’ and their role in creating modern consumer society. How has their use of an emotional model of brand communication, whether in political campaigning or product advertising, transformed our understanding of the rational consumer? He’s joined by Steven McKevitt, Visiting Professor in Brand Communication, at Leeds Beckett University. Also, how ‘branding’ can desensitize far right consumers to extremist ideas. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Associate Professor of Education and Sociology at American University, discusses her study into the ways in which extremism is going mainstream in Germany through clothing brands laced with racist and nationalist symbols. Producer: Jayne Egerton
