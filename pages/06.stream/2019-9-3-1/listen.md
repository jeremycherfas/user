Episode summary: Throughout the 1960s, a biologist named Howard Temin became convinced that something wasn’t right in science’s understanding of viruses. His colleagues dismissed him as a heretic. He turned out to be right — and you’re alive today as a result. Season Four ends with a bedtime story about how we should be freed by our doubts, not imprisoned by them.

Another fascinating disinterring, and as this was a story I knew something about, I kept waiting for Gladwell to say something about Luc Montagnier. And then I realised that he had very cleverly stopped short of saying anything about Bob Gallo's rôle in the identification of HIV.
