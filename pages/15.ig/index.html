More to the point, he told me that the Xylella epidemic, which has killed more than 11 million olive trees in the Salento might just be a blessing in disguise if it allows a new kind of olive grower to build a new kind of oil business in the Salento.\n\nListen at https://www.eatthispodcast.com/olives/ with clickable link in bio.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726594158": {"i": 215, "m": ["media/posts/202409/d116e777.jpg"], "t": 1726594158, "d": "September 17, 2024 at 05:29 PM", "tt": "Andromeda Barbie", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726522168": {"i": 216, "m": ["media/posts/202409/8a867faf.jpg"], "t": 1726522168, "d": "September 16, 2024 at 09:29 PM", "tt": "Another fine walk along the strand on a glorious day.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726468494": {"i": 217, "m": ["media/posts/202409/8381d8de.jpg"], "t": 1726468494, "d": "September 16, 2024 at 06:34 AM", "tt": "Looking south from Malin Head, a place to conjure wild thoughts.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726329391": {"i": 218, "m": ["media/posts/202409/38496644.jpg"], "t": 1726329391, "d": "September 14, 2024 at 03:56 PM", "tt": "Breezy walk to the Downhill Demesne.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726164001": {"i": 219, "m": ["media/posts/202409/df530afd.jpg"], "t": 1726164001, "d": "September 12, 2024 at 06:00 PM", "tt": "Also seen, sculpted sand.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1726163958": {"i": 220, "m": ["media/posts/202409/d006e433.jpg", "media/posts/202409/1483ac98.jpg"], "t": 1726163958, "d": "September 12, 2024 at 05:59 PM", "tt": "Seen on the walk, two washed up lion's mane jellyfish.

Lower hydration helps keep the dough structured, and baking from a cold start keeps things marginally cooler.\n\nAround this time of year my little microbial helpers need a dash of tender loving care, but with temperatures in the high 30s°C I wasn't super keen to look after the bread leavens. Of course I could have just refreshed them without actually baking, but where's the fun in that, and in any case stocks of frozen bread were dwindling fast. So, yesterday I took a look at the stiffer starter.\n\nIt wasn't good. \n\nThe top was dark and slimy, the driest parts powdery (with spores?) and a fair bit of liquid hooch. The smell wasn't reassurring either. But I'm here to reassure you that all was well and that if you are ever faced with a neglected starter, there's no need to abandon it. \n\nTurning the lump over, the base was perfectly fine, so I dug out a small spoonful, trying not to break through to the other side, fed it, and left it to get going.\n\nOne thing about the heat; it got going in a hurry. Three hours later it was light and well aerated. Time for a second build. Again, three hours was about all it took to more than double in volume. I made the bulk dough, gave it a quick knead and left it on the counter for an hour. One set of folds and into the fridge overnight.\n\nThis morning I took it out, nicely risen, gently shaped it, and placed it in a banneton. Normally I preheat the oven and my Le Creuset casserole for 35 minutes before baking. Given the heat, no way. Cold cloche, then, as per Elizabeth David. Lid removed after 30 minutes, baked for a further 20 minutes.\n\nThe result was very acceptable. Not as much oven spring perhaps, but plenty, and a nice, even crumb.

You tell me.\n\nhttps://eatthispodcast.com/passover-again with cliackable link in bio", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1713037504": {"i": 330, "m": ["media/posts/202404/a2fcb031.jpg"], "t": 1713037504, "d": "April 13, 2024 at 07:45 PM", "tt": "A lot of schnitzel.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1713018855": {"i": 331, "m": ["media/posts/202404/2df47b76.jpg"], "t": 1713018855, "d": "April 13, 2024 at 02:34 PM", "tt": "One of the more majestic museum entrances … and a wonderful collection.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1712928521": {"i": 332, "m": ["media/posts/202404/7d11fe26.jpg"], "t": 1712928521, "d": "April 12, 2024 at 01:28 PM", "tt": "I feel like one of 20,000 dots that nobody would miss if I stopped moving.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1712848825": {"i": 333, "m": ["media/posts/202404/4e09422a.jpg"], "t": 1712848825, "d": "April 11, 2024 at 03:20 PM", "tt": "Not as dramatic as the Semmeringbahn, which engineering works are keeping us from, but still picture-postcard pretty on the way to Linz.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1712818164": {"i": 334, "m": ["media/posts/202404/e21360da.jpg"], "t": 1712818164, "d": "April 11, 2024 at 06:49 AM", "tt": "Farewell Venice.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1712779729": {"i": 335, "m": ["media/posts/202404/41aa27a4.jpg"], "t": 1712779729, "d": "April 10, 2024 at 08:08 PM", "tt": "Rain stopped play, temporarily.

These days, it celebrates the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, but a couple of thousand years ago it was the peak of Emperor Augustus' Feriae Augusti. How are they connected, and why is the constellation Virgo carrying a wheatsheaf?\n\nYou'll have to listen to find out at https://www.eatthispodcast.com/our-daily-bread-15/\n\nAll the other women associated with the constellation Virgo in times gone by were Mother Goddesses, responsible for the harvest and fecundity more generally. I don't know that the Virgin Mary is literally linked to the harvest in any way (although I have found fascinating metaphorical accounts, to which I may return). She is, though, indubitably a mother goddess.\n\nIn the episode, I talk about looking for Spica about halfway between Jupiter and Venus. Alas, those pesky wanderers are now visible as morning \"stars\" and so no help.

If you give them lots of lush, high quality food, they turn it into meat, milk and eggs remarkably efficiently. Of course, you also often have to provide housing, medication and lots of other things too.\n\nThere's another way to think about efficiency, and that's an animal that can turn rough herbage, which humans couldn't possibly eat, into things we can eat. In so doing, they can protect biodiversity and help store carbon in the soil. And they don't need nearly as much pampering.\n\nI talked to Lawrence Alderson, founder of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, about the importance of heritage livestock. He points out that we're going to need the good, cultivatable land to produce food directly for people. Heritage breeds grazing on land that cannot be easily cultivated will give us animal-sourced foods truly efficiently.\n\nListen at https://eatthispodcast.com/rare-breeds or find a clickable link in the bio.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1612018363": {"i": 1180, "m": ["media/posts/202101/c470f551.mp4"], "t": 1612018363, "d": "January 30, 2021 at 02:52 PM", "tt": "Beautiful day at the beach.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1611949317": {"i": 1181, "m": ["media/posts/202101/f935e1d1.jpg"], "t": 1611949317, "d": "January 29, 2021 at 07:41 PM", "tt": "A fine Friday night supper.

I know which I mean when, but that doesn't help people who are just beginning. So, I thought I would clarify with an example.\n\nThis week's big bake will amount to 3 kg of dough, and my formula calls for 33% of that to be pre-fermented leaven. So, I need to build about 950 gm of leaven. For this particular bread, I always use the white flour starter that I keep at 100% hydration. I know that I've got about 100 gm of starter in the fridge, because I refreshed it just last week.\n\nSo, I remove 75 gm of the starter and mix it with 150 gm of flour and 150 gm of water. 1:2:2 in ratio terms. That keeps the hydration at 100% and does not give the starter too much to chew on as it becomes the first build of leaven.\n\nAt the same time, I now have only 25 gm of starter left. I could leave it at that and stick it back in the fridge, but I refresh that too. That means adding 50 gm of flour and 50 gm of water, exactly the same ratios as the first build.\n\nBoth of them will stay out now for about 12 hours; it is getting cold here. Then this evening, the starter will go back in the fridge. The first build, which currently weighs 375gm, will get 290 gm of flour and 290 gm of water, takings the amount of the second build up to 955 gm, which gives me a slight excess to work with.\n\nTomorrow, I'll use all the leaven to raise the sourdough, which won't be at all sour. 😂", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1574005462": {"i": 1554, "m": ["media/posts/201911/32e1c117.jpg"], "t": 1574005462, "d": "November 17, 2019 at 03:44 PM", "tt": "Magma cum laude graduates of #SourdoughU today at #latteriastudio", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1573977636": {"i": 1555, "m": ["media/posts/201911/2f81a113.jpg"], "t": 1573977636, "d": "November 17, 2019 at 08:00 AM", "tt": "Ready to roll for today's one-day course of #SourdoughU at the beautiful space of #latteriastudio", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1573912649": {"i": 1556, "m": ["media/posts/201911/28909fcc.jpg"], "t": 1573912649, "d": "November 16, 2019 at 01:57 PM", "tt": "Queen for a day @jomo23", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1573912564": {"i": 1557, "m": ["media/posts/201911/7ac6fc99.jpg"], "t": 1573912564, "d": "November 16, 2019 at 01:56 PM", "tt": "Queen for a day. @jomo23", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1573750702": {"i": 1558, "m": ["media/posts/201911/c244c669.jpg"], "t": 1573750702, "d": "November 14, 2019 at 04:58 PM", "tt": "Six seedy sourdoughs. \nInteresting difference in colour in the two larger loaves, baked in a cast iron casserole.", "im": "", "l": "", "c": ""}, "1573645954": {"i": 1559, "m": ["media/posts/201911/fb635154.jpg"], "t": 1573645954, "d": "November 13, 2019 at 11:52 AM", "tt": "This morning's workout: 4.6 kg of seedy dough.
