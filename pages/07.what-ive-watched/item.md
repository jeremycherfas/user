              <li class="log-item"><em>The Power of Metaphor</em> by Mike Hill <strong>Tk</strong> Really interesting, very detiled look at Joseph Campbell and Carl Gustav Jung in the movies especially, for me, in Jurassic Park, which I now want to see again.</li>

              <li class="log-item"><em>Stranger Things S02</em> <strong>T</strong> If anything, better than S01. (My verdict after five episodes.)</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
              <li class="log-item">Finished <em>Stranger Things S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Great fun, and the kids -- especially Eleven -- are just great. I still hate the loud noise = scary trope, but there's not much I can do about that. Will we watch S02? Not entirely a given at the moment.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="log-item">Finished <em>Three Hands in the Fountain</em> <strong>B</strong> [Another jolly good Roman romp](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/reviews/three-hands-in-the-fountain).</li>

        <ul>
        	<li class="log-item"><em>Our Planet S01e01</em> <strong>T</strong> Too little, too late, but still stunning.</li>
            <li class="log-item"><em>Domus Aurea</em> <strong>A</strong> Absolutely spell-binding, especially the virtual reality. Weekends only, and not cheap, but entirely worthwhile.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
              <li class="log-item"><em>Godless S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, and what a treat it was. Of all the genres, I really do like westerns best of all, I think, and this one was really up there. Predictable, but what's wrong with that? I can't imagine there will be a second series, but I can hope.</li>

            <ul>
              <li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S02</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, just as I returned from a week in Ireland. I don't have any clear notion of how accurate the series is, but the drama is good and gripping and the production values high. Most enjoyable.</li>

          <ul>
            <li class="log-item"><em>Stranger Things s01</em> <strong>T</strong> Not yet sure what all the fuss is about. I can't stand the cheap trick of sudden superloud noise = scary. Because it is.</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
    <li class="log-day">23</li>

      <li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S02</em> <strong>T</strong> Season Two fast forwards four years to the 1920s. Still very watchable.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>Godless S01e01</em> <strong>T</strong> Been meaning to watch this for a while, and luckily it cropped up on a list The Main Squeeze was taking notice of. Good cowboy stuff, all the usual tropes. Should be fun.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>  <ul class="log-entry">
    <li class="log-day">22</li>
    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>Triple Frontier</em> <strong>F</strong> Netflix original, special ops heist movie. Pretty good, with lots of atmospheric jungle and manly, soldierly hugs among the band of brothers. You know it will all go wrong, of course, and when it does there's a bit of a *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* vibe to it. No dead beews though. And a nice open ending.</li>
    </ul>

    <li class="log-day">20</li>
    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, finally. And the reason it took so long was simply that it is so hard to watch. Utterly gripping, and equally hard to make sense of. Were the protests and Nixon's Silent Majority the start of the current almost complete fission in America's polity?</li>
    </ul>

  <ul class="log-entry">
    <li class="log-day">19</li>

      <li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished watching Season One. A bit black and white, but well made and engaging.</li>

    <li class="log-day">5</li>
    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S01E01</em> <strong>T</strong> The Easter Uprising and consequences from Netflix. Rather good.</li>

  <ul class="log-entry">
    <li class="log-day">3-4</li>
    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War e08</em> <strong>T</strong> My Lai and Cambodia. Almost unwatchable, and cannot take my eyes off it.</li>
    </ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
    <li class="log-day">2</li>
    <ul>
      <li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War e07</em> <strong>T</strong> So harrowing, and so important. This episode closed with Kent State, and if the cops now could see the cops then and <em>vice versa</em> ...</li>

    <li class="log-day">1</li>
