</ul>
</ul>

<li class="log-month">September</li>

Much happened, none of it recorded because holidays make these things unimportant. I read Colm Toibín's The Heather Ablaze and loved it. We watched a few episodes of Shogun and the original Beetlejuice; what was all the fuss about? And we watched Line of Duty. A lot.

<li class="log-month">October</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">16</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Fraud</em> by Zadie Smith <strong>B</strong> Absolute magic. The first of Smith's books I've read, which I did only because I had run out of fiction and The Squeeze had just bought it. After about five pages I simply could not put it down. Fiction is so much better than fact, sometimes.</li>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Slow Horses s04</em> on Apple TV <strong>T</strong> Still gripping, but maybe sliding, a little? And yes, fiction is still so much better than fact, sometimes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">14</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Line of Duty s06</em> on Acorn TV <strong>T</strong> and what a ride it was. Started at some point in September in Northern Ireland, where I am able to use iPlayer, and just squeezed in under the wire on a trial membership of Acorn TV, which seems to offer nothing else of interest. I wonder, in fact, how they snagged LoD. In any case, a stunningly effective long arc of drama. To me, the echoes of actual events -- Cyril Smith, Stephen Lawrence -- made it all the more believable, and the triumph of The Institution at the end all the more depressing. Jed Mercurio really is rather talented.</li>
</ul>

<li class="log-month">November</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">24</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Nomadland</em> on AppleTV <strong>F</strong> Very engaging and, in its way, lyrical. Or maybe elegaic? Beautifully made.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
