<ul class="log">

<li class="log-month">June</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">30</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Giri/Haji</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Such stylish violence. Bonus points if the messy ending does **not** presage a second series.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">28</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Guns Akimbo</em> on Prime <strong>F</strong> Mindless mayhem, with jokes, because I was on my own.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">12</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Giri/Haji</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Rather classy, so far. Keep expecting Luther to swagger in.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">11</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Homeland s05</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong>Carrie saves the day, Otto makes his move, and Peter … (Couldn’t help seeing the summary for s06e01)</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">09</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Bosch s06</em> on Prime <strong>T</strong> Nuanced ambiguity right down to the end. Very satisfying.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li class="log-month">May</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">23</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Chinatown</em> on iTunes <strong>F</strong> Had forgotten enough to make it an absolute treat to watch.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">17</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Bosch s06</em> on Prime <strong>T</strong> Still too many threads unravelling for my taste, but compelling watching nevertheless.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">16</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Homeland s05</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> And they're still at it.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">15</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Bosch s05</em> on Prime <strong>T</strong> Reliably dark, reliably tortured, reliably confusing. Is Bosch really that saintly? Will he spoil things for Chief Irving?</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">14</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>The Code s02</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Pretty well done, I thought, but maybe a tad too slick.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">09</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em> by Amor Towles <strong>B</strong> A different kind of life in Russia. I loved it <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/a-gentleman-in-moscow">beyond words</a>.</li>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>The Road to Calvary</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> They should have just called it All's Well That Ends Well. Except, it didn't end all that well, after the end of the story.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">02</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Code s02</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Maybe they got a bit too much cash to spend on the strength of s01?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<li class="log-month">April</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">30</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Ozark s03</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Blimy! Can't say I saw that ending coming. Are these the worst, most compelling people in TV? And can we get a Darlene prequel?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">28</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Unorthodox</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Really very good, as a partial insight into the community and escape. The Making of ... was very good too, and illuminating. So the whole music aspect was fiction?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">20</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Bosch s05</em> on Prime <strong>T</strong> The hoohah over s06 made us realise we hadn't seen s05, which is nice.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">20</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started reading <em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em> by Amor Towles <strong>B</strong> Loving it from the outset.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">19</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Nikita</em> on iTunes <strong>F</strong> I could have sworn I had seen this, but couldn't remember any of it. Turns out I was thinking of Léon. Luc Besson clearly has a thing for gorgeous women assassins.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 


<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">11</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Unorthdox</em> On Netflix <strong>T</strong> Rather good, especially the lead.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">05</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>The Code s01</em> <strong>T</strong> Really rather well done disturbed genius hacker stuff. There's a second series, but I'm not sure it can sustain that.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<li class="log-month">March</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">28</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Ozark s03</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> So compelling.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">25</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Wanted s03</em> <strong>T</strong> as they drove slowly into peace of the sunset. For how long?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">23</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Code s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Rather good Aussie crime in high places caper.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">21</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Rose Tattoo</em> on iTunes <strong>F</strong> Strange film, shot on Key West, which was why we watched it, with Anna Magnina and Burt Lancaster. She plays a woman widowed by her cheating husband, who eventually falls for Burt. Dated, histrionic, fun. Tennessee Williams wrote. Now, a competition: who was the worst young Italian? Burt, in this, or Warren Beatty in _The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone_, another Williams classic.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">18</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Ghostbusters</em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> The girlie one; I thought it was excellent. Why all the hate?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">15</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Road to Calvary</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Russian period drama, strangely entertaining, like a Russian Gone with the Wind.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">10</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Wanted s03</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> They're still on the run; Huntingdon's seems like a bit of a McGuffin.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">08</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Ottomans</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Mehmed got there in the end, as we knew he would. </li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">06</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>The Stranger s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Very satisfying, in the end, but although they are clearly leaving enough loose ends for a second season, I'm not sure how compelling it will really be.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">03</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Oldest Road: The Ridgeway</em> <strong>B</strong> and can't wait to start tramping, coronavirus willing.</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">24</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Better Call Saul s05</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Less than compelling this time around. May need time.</li>

</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">22</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Secret Pilgrim</em> by John Le Carré <strong>B</strong> Such fine storytelling, and cleverly done as a series of reminiscences at a special dinner, each a short story.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">19</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Stranger</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Note from the future: Very well done, and I suppose eventually **all** the threads will come together.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">16</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Coldest Game</em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> Strange Cold War caper, around the Bay of Pigs. Fictional tosh, and diverting.</li>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Final Solution</em> by Michael Chabon <strong>B</strong> Terrifically fun story of The Great Detective at death's door. Very entertaining, but what is it with Chabon and parrots?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">14</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Saw (heard?) <em>Norma</em> by Bellini at the San Carlo, Naples <strong>Th</strong> Sublime, in all respects.</li>

</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">8</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Two Popes</em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> Broke halfway through as it was getting past our bedtime. Easy to do.</li>

<li class="log-day">7</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>Agent Running in the Field</em> by John le Carré on Kindle <strong>B</strong> Absolutely thrilling stuff, never mind the loose ends, and so beautifully told.</li>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Messiah s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Somewhat far-fetched ending, but has been solid throughout, and suitably enigmatic.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">5</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Rise of Empires: Ottoman</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Interesting mix of talking heads, strangely rendered, and drama, equally strangely rendered.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">4</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Saw <em>1917</em> at the Nuovo Olimpia <strong>F</strong> Astonishing feat of cinematographic story-telling; I'd love to see it with a director's commentary.</li>
