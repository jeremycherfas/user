<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">29</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Diagnosis s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Interesting, although I find it too "emotional" and not enough about actual diagnosis. I'm sure I'm in a minority.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">26</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Jack Taylor s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Rather good Irish rogue cop with drinking and family problems.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">22</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Dogtown and Z-boys</em> on iTunes <strong>F</strong> It had been on my list for a long time, and now that I've seen it, I'm very glad I have. Such fun, and terrifying.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">20</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished <em>The Spy</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Really excellent, and in a way I'm glad we were told how it would end. The muted tones of the Israeli scenes were very good. Sacha Baron Cohen was terrifically impressive.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">16</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>The Bletchley Circle San Francisco s01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Rather good period stuff, a bit anachronistic in places, but ripping good fun.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">09</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Spy e01</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Promising. Sacha Baron Cohen is very good</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">08</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>American Factory</em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> Solid, straightforward treatment; no surprises, no prognostications.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li class="log-month">August</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">31</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Blinded by the Light</em> at the Nuovo Olympia <strong>F</strong> Two fairy tales in one week. My cup runneth over. Great movie, well done. I wonder what the rest of the world will make of Luton?</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">29</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>When they see us</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Harrowing</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">28</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Diagnosis</em> On Netflix <strong>T</strong> A little too "emotional" for my taste, but that goes with the territory.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">27</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Designated Survivor s03</em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> Still tosh, still entertaining.</li>
<li class="log-item">Started reading <em>The Crooked Scythe</em> by George Ewart Evans <strong>B</strong> </li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">26</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Biggest Little Farm</em> outdoors at the Nuovo Sacher <strong>F</strong> A fairy story for grownups, and enjoyable for all that. But they aren't the first, and, I hope, won't be the last. I'd love to see the balance sheet though.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">25</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Man Who Would Be King</em> on iTunes <strong>F</strong> and a very watchable epic it was too. <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/by-jingo-i-do-enjoy-kipling">By Jingo, I do enjoy Kipling</a>.
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The World-wide Work</em> by Ethan Marcotte at New Adventures conference <strong>Tk</strong> Extremely interesting, though <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/time-for-a-talk">I disagree on one, fairly small, point</a>.
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">24</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Man Who Would Be King</em> by Rudyard Kipling <strong>B</strong> Very enjoyable, although one problem with Gutenberg editions is the lack of explanatory footnotes. Things Kipling could take as read, I couldn't always fathom from context.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li class="log-day">21</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>The Appian Way: Ghost Road, Queen of Roads </em>by Robert A. Kaster <strong>B</strong> Very entertaining; a lot of learning, lightly worn, delightfully transmitted.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">17</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Baby Driver </em>on Netflix <strong>F</strong> This I had seen before, on a flight, and loved it then. But the Main Squeeze had not. Is this *The Princess Bride* for boys? (We both enjoyed both, a lot, so do not take this as a serious genedered comment.) Great soundtrack, great chases, good resolution, if a little fabulous.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">16</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>The Princess Bride </em> on Netflix <strong>F</strong> I know, how can I not have already seen this? But I hadn't. Now I have. And it was delightful.</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">11</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Stranger Things s03</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> Cracking good stuff, and for all the money sloshing about that I moaned about before, very well done. I'm still a bit dubious about the Mindflayer's biomechanics, but that's almost certainly just me. The final tease sequence suggests the vague possibility that Hopper endures, which will be interesting if, as rumours suggest, he may have to face Eleven in s04.</li>

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">29</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Watched <em>Vice</em> on iTunes  <strong>F</strong> Very weird, very entertaining, and overall quite scary.</li>
</ul>
</ul> 

<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">28</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished reading <em>Love Among the Chickens</em> by P.G. Wodehouse, from Gutenberg. <strong>B</strong> Entertaining, slight romp; not enough about chickens (and especially not about <a href="https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=PRP18841227.2.7.2&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1">roup and how to treat it</a>

<li class="log-day">25</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Sheltering Sky</em> in Piazza San Cosimato <strong>F</strong> A show of two halves; the death of Port Moresby and Among the Tuareg. Beautifully shot, not too much in the way of good sense.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">22</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Stranger Things s03</em> and my, how the kids have grown up. <strong>T</strong> Some signs that success has gone to the Duffers&#8217; heads, via their wallets. The big, period set pieces are overdone, rather like what happened to Mrs Maisel.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">21</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished watching <em>Years &amp; Years</em> <strong>T</strong> The very end, with Edith&#8217;s brain dump and re-animation, was possibly the weakest part of the show, but I suppose they had to offer some sort of hope. I&#8217;d pay money to see the current PM dressed in red and scuttling down a red corridor.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="log-month">June</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">25</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Dead Don&#8217;t Die</em> <strong>F</strong> Absolutely wonderful genre-benre from Jim Jarmusch taking everything everyone knows about zombie movies and subverting it. Superb deadpan performances from Adam Driver and Bill Murray; Tilda Swinton is gloriously loopy; the whole thing a blast from start to (inevitable) finish. Concept reminded me a whole lot of Let The Right One In.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">23</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Years &amp; Years</em> in iTunes <strong>T</strong> Wonderfully prescient, and terrific opening sequence of those few years passing by.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">22</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Started watching <em>Designated Survivor S03</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> More heart-warming tosh, I&#8217;m glad to say.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">13</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Name of the Rose</em> on Netflix <strong>T</strong> At last it&#8217;s over, the huge budget spent, the fake snow swept away, the extras with interesting faces sent home. Alas, William of Baskerville did not utter the immortal &#8220;I expect you&#8217;re wondering why I&#8217;ve asked you to gather in the library,&#8221; but he should have.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">05</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Power of Metaphor</em> by Mike Hill <strong>Tk</strong> Really interesting, very detailed look at Joseph Campbell and Carl Gustav Jung in the movies especially, for me, in Jurassic Park, which I now want to see again.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="log-month">May</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">30</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Hare With Amber Eyes: A Hidden Inheritance</em> by Edmund de Waal <strong>B</strong> <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/reviews/the-hare-with-amber-eyes">So. Very. Good.</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">14</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Stranger Things S02</em> <strong>T</strong> If anything, better than S01. (My verdict after five episodes.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">08</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item">Finished <em>Stranger Things S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Great fun, and the kids &#8211; especially Eleven &#8211; are just great. I still hate the loud noise = scary trope, but there&#8217;s not much I can do about that. Will we watch S02? Not entirely a given at the moment.</li>
<li class="log-item">Finished <em>Three Hands in the Fountain</em> <strong>B</strong> <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/reviews/three-hands-in-the-fountain">Another jolly good Roman romp</a>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">05</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Organ recital at San Antonio dei Portoghesi</em> <strong>M</strong> Improvisation. &#8217;Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">04</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Our Planet S01e01</em> <strong>T</strong> Too little, too late, but still stunning.</li>
 <li class="log-item"><em>Domus Aurea</em> <strong>A</strong> Absolutely spell-binding, especially the virtual reality. Weekends only, and not cheap, but entirely worthwhile.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="log-month">April</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">18</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Godless S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, and what a treat it was. Of all the genres, I really do like westerns best of all, I think, and this one was really up there. Predictable, but what&#8217;s wrong with that? I can&#8217;t imagine there will be a second series, but I can hope.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">11</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S02</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, just as I returned from a week in Ireland. I don&#8217;t have any clear notion of how accurate the series is, but the drama is good and gripping and the production values high. Most enjoyable.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="log-month">March</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">25</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Stranger Things s01</em> <strong>T</strong> Not yet sure what all the fuss is about. I can&#8217;t stand the cheap trick of sudden superloud noise = scary. Because it is.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">23</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S02</em> <strong>T</strong> Season Two fast forwards four years to the 1920s. Still very watchable.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">23</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Godless S01e01</em> <strong>T</strong> Been meaning to watch this for a while, and luckily it cropped up on a list The Main Squeeze was taking notice of. Good cowboy stuff, all the usual tropes. Should be fun.</li>
</ul>
</ul><ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">22</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Triple Frontier</em> <strong>F</strong> Netflix original, special ops heist movie. Pretty good, with lots of atmospheric jungle and manly, soldierly hugs among the band of brothers. You know it will all go wrong, of course, and when it does there&#8217;s a bit of a <em>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em> vibe to it. No dead beews though. And a nice open ending.</li>
</ul>
</ul> <ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">20</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished, finally. And the reason it took so long was simply that it is so hard to watch. Utterly gripping, and equally hard to make sense of. Were the protests and Nixon&#8217;s Silent Majority the start of the current almost complete fission in America&#8217;s polity?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">19</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S01</em> <strong>T</strong> Finished watching Season One. A bit black and white, but well made and engaging.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">5</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Rebellion S01E01</em> <strong>T</strong> The Easter Uprising and consequences from Netflix. Rather good.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">3&#8211;4</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War e08</em> <strong>T</strong> My Lai and Cambodia. Almost unwatchable, and cannot take my eyes off it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">2</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Vietnam War e07</em> <strong>T</strong> So harrowing, and so important. This episode closed with Kent State, and if the cops now could see the cops then and <em>vice versa</em> &#8230;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">1</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Mrs Maisel S02</em> <strong>T</strong> One or two episodes where they definitely thought too much of themselves, but overall still strong and still funny. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="log-month">February</li>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">11</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>Luther s05 finished</em> <strong>T</strong> So dark. London is the true star, but when were there ever that many serial killers?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul class="log-entry">
<li class="log-day">9</li>
<ul>
<li class="log-item"><em>The Green Book</em> <strong>F</strong> Very entertaining, very ordinary. And then Spotify played me some Don Shirley Trio. </li>
</ul>
